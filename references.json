    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Analysis of the angioarchitecture and quantification of the conduit vessels and microvasculature is of paramount importance for understanding the physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system (CNS). Most of the available in vivo imaging methods lack penetration depth and/or resolution. Some ex vivo methods may provide better resolution, but are mainly destructive, as they are designed for imaging the CNS tissues after their removal from the skull or vertebral column. The removal procedure inevitably alters the in situ relations of the investigated structures and damages the dura mater and leptomeninges. µAngiofil, a polymer-based contrast agent, permits a qualitatively novel postmortem microangio-computed tomography (microangioCT) approach with excellent resolution and, therefore, visualization of the smallest brain capillaries. The datasets obtained empower a rather straightforward quantitative analysis of the vascular tree, including the microvasculature. The µAngiofil has an excellent filling capacity as well as a radio-opacity higher than the one of bone tissue, which allows imaging the cerebral microvasculature even within the intact skull or vertebral column. This permits in situ visualization and thus investigation of the dura mater and leptomeningeal layers as well as their blood supply in their original geometry. Moreover, the methodology introduced here permits correlative approaches, i.e., microangioCT followed by classical histology, immunohistochemistry and even electron microscopy. The experimental approach presented here makes use of common desktop microCT scanners, rendering it a promising everyday tool for the evaluation of the (micro)vasculature of the central nervous system in preclinical and basic research.\n</jats:p>",

Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap in the relationship of blood vessels to cranial skeletal progenitors during these processes. Here, we introduce a quantitative 3D imaging platform to enable the visualization and analysis of high-resolution data sets (&gt;100 GB) throughout the entire murine calvarium. Using this technique, we provide single-cell resolution 3D maps of vessel phenotypes and skeletal progenitors in the frontoparietal cranial bones. Through these high-resolution data sets, we demonstrate that CD31<jats:sup>hi</jats:sup>Emcn<jats:sup>hi</jats:sup> vessels are spatially correlated with both Osterix+ and Gli1+ skeletal progenitors during postnatal growth, healing, and stimulated remodeling, and are concentrated at transcortical canals and osteogenic fronts. Interestingly, we find that this relationship is weakened in mice with a conditional knockout of PDGF-BB in TRAP+ osteoclasts, suggesting a potential role for osteoclasts in maintaining the native cranial microvascular environment. Our findings provide a foundational framework for understanding how blood vessels and skeletal progenitors spatially interact in cranial bone, and will enable more targeted studies into the mechanisms of skull disease pathologies and treatments. Additionally, our technique can be readily adapted to study numerous cell types and investigate other elusive phenomena in cranial bone biology.</jats:p>",

As blood vessels in bone are deeply encased in the calcified matrix, imaging techniques that are applicable to soft tissues are generally difficult or impossible to apply to the skeleton. While canals in cortical bone can readily be identified and characterised in X-ray computed tomographic data in 3D, the soft tissue comprising blood vessels that are putatively contained within the canal structures does not provide sufficient image contrast necessary for image segmentation. Here, we report an approach that allows for rapid, simultaneous visualisation of calcified bone tissue and the vasculature within the calcified bone matrix. Using synchrotron X-ray phase contrast-enhanced tomography we show exemplar data with intracortical capillaries uncovered at sub-micrometre level without the need for any staining or contrast agent. Using the tibiofibular junction of 15 week-old C57BL/6 mice post mortem, we show the bone cortical porosity simultaneously along with the soft tissue comprising the vasculature. Validation with histology confirms that we can resolve individual capillaries. This imaging approach could be easily applied to other skeletal sites and transgenic models, and could improve our understanding of the role the vasculature plays in bone disease.</jats:p>",

The perfusion efficiency of μAngiofil<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> was validated based on lectin-stained histological sections: 98 ± 0.5% of the blood vessels were μAngiofil<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>-positive, whereas 93 ± 2.6% were lectin-positive. By applying this approach we analyzed the angiogenesis induced by the cell-based delivery of a controlled VEGF dose. Vascular density increased by 426% mainly through the augmentation of medium-sized vessels (20–40 μm). The introduced correlative and quantitative imaging approach is highly reproducible and allows a detailed 3D characterization of the vasculature and muscle tissue.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Vascular tissue engineering has the potential to make a significant impact on the treatment of a wide variety of medical conditions, including providing in vitro generated vascularized tissue and organ constructs for transplantation. Since the first report on the construction of a biological blood vessel, significant research and technological advances have led to the generation of clinically relevant large and small diameter tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs). However, developing a biocompatible blood-contacting surface is still a major challenge. Researchers are using biomimicry to generate functional vascular grafts and vascular networks. A multi-disciplinary approach is being used that includes biomaterials, cells, pro-angiogenic factors and microfabrication technologies. Techniques to achieve spatiotemporal control of vascularization include use of topographical engineering and controlled-release of growth/pro-angiogenic factors. Use of decellularized natural scaffolds has gained popularity for engineering complex vascularized organs for potential clinical use. Pre-vascularization of constructs prior to implantation has also been shown to enhance its anastomosis after implantation. Host-implant anastomosis is a phenomenon that is still not fully understood. However, it will be a critical factor in determining the in vivo success of a TEVGs or bioengineered organ. Many clinical studies have been conducted using TEVGs, but vascularized tissue/organ constructs are still in the research &amp; development stage. In addition to technical challenges, there are commercialization and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed. In this review we examine recent advances in the field of vascular tissue engineering, with a focus on technology trends, challenges and potential clinical applications.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Vascularization is a crucial step during musculoskeletal tissue regeneration via bioengineered constructs or grafts. Functional vasculature provides oxygen and nutrients to the graft microenvironment, facilitates wound healing, enhances graft integration with host tissue, and ensures the long-term survival of regenerating tissue. Therefore, imaging de novo vascularization (i.e., angiogenesis), changes in microvascular morphology, and the establishment and maintenance of perfusion within the graft site (i.e., vascular microenvironment or VME) can provide essential insights into engraftment, wound healing, as well as inform the design of tissue engineering (TE) constructs. In this review, we focus on state-of-the-art imaging approaches for monitoring the VME in craniofacial TE applications, as well as future advances in this field. We describe how cutting-edge in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods can yield invaluable information regarding VME parameters that can help characterize the effectiveness of different TE constructs and iteratively inform their design for enhanced craniofacial bone regeneration. Finally, we explicate how the integration of novel TE constructs, preclinical model systems, imaging techniques, and systems biology approaches could usher in an era of “image-based tissue engineering.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last decades, the contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging of a whole animal kidney became increasingly important. The visualization was mainly limited to middle-sized vessels. Since modern desktop micro-CT scanners provide the necessary detail resolution, we developed an approach for rapid visualization and consistent assessment of kidney vasculature and glomeruli number. This method is based on μAngiofil, a new polymerizing contrast agent with homogenous X-ray absorption, which provides continuous filling of the complete vasculature and enables correlative imaging approaches. For rapid and reliable kidney morphometry, the microangio-CT (µaCT) data sets from glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)<jats:sup>+/−</jats:sup>mice and their wild-type littermates were used. The results were obtained much faster compared with the current gold standard, histology-based stereology, and without processing artifacts. The histology-based morphometry was done afterward on the same kidneys. Both approaches revealed that the GDNF<jats:sup>+/−</jats:sup>male mice had about 40% fewer glomeruli. Furthermore, our approach allows for the definition of sites of interest for further histological investigation, i.e., correlative morphology. The polymerized μAngiofil stays in perfused vessels and is autofluorescent, which is what greatly facilitates the matching of histological sections with µaCT data. The presented approach is a time-efficient, reliable, qualitative, and quantitative methodology. Besides glomerular morphometry, the µaCT data can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the kidney vasculature and correlative morphology.</jats:p>",

When prostate cancer acquires castration resistance, incurable metastases, primarily in the bone, occur. The aim of this study is to test the applicability of targeting melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; CD146) with a mAb for the treatment of lytic prostate cancer bone metastasis. We evaluated the effect of targeting MCAM using in vivo preclinical bone metastasis models and an in vitro bone niche coculture system. We utilized FACS, cell proliferation assays, and gene expression profiling to study the phenotype and function of MCAM knockdown in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the impact of MCAM targeting and therapeutic applicability, we employed an anti-MCAM mAb in vivo. MCAM is elevated in prostate cancer metastases resistant to androgen ablation. Treatment with DHT showed MCAM upregulation upon castration. We investigated the function of MCAM in a direct coculture model of human prostate cancer cells with human osteoblasts and found that there is a reduced influence of human osteoblasts on human prostate cancer cells in which MCAM has been knocked down. Furthermore, we observed a strongly reduced formation of osteolytic lesions upon bone inoculation of MCAM-depleted human prostate cancer cells in animal model of prostate cancer bone metastasis. This phenotype is supported by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Importantly, in vivo administration of an anti-MCAM human mAb reduced the tumor growth and lytic lesions. These results highlight the functional role for MCAM in the development of lytic bone metastasis and suggest that MCAM is a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer bone metastasis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Implications:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study highlights the functional application of an anti-MCAM mAb to target prostate cancer bone metastasis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Bone metastases are frequent complications of breast cancer, facilitating the development of anarchic vascularization and induce bone destruction. Therefore, anti-angiogenic drugs (AAD) have been tested as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis. However, the kinetics of skeletal vascularization in response to tumor invasion under AAD is still partially understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of AAD on experimental bone metastasis by analyzing the three-dimensional (3D) bone vasculature during metastatic formation and progression. Seventy-three eight-week-old female mice were treated with AAD (bevacizumab, vatalanib, or a combination of both drugs) or the vehicle (placebo) one day after injection with breast cancer cells. Mice were sacrificed eight or 22 days after tumor cell inoculation (time points T1 and T2, respectively). Synchrotron radiation microcomputed tomography (SR-μCT) was used to image bone and blood vessels with a contrast agent. Hence, 3D-bone and vascular networks were simultaneously visualized and quantitatively analyzed. At T1, the trabecular bone volume fraction was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the combined AAD-treatment group, compared to the placebo- and single AAD-treatment groups. At T2, only the bone vasculature was reduced in the combined AAD-treatment group (p &lt; 0.05), as judged by measurement of the blood vessel thickness. Our data suggest that, at the early stage, combined AAD treatment dampens tumor-induced bone resorption with no detectable effects on bone vessel organization while, at a later stage, it affects the structure of bone microvascularization.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cardiovascular malformations and diseases are common but complex and often not yet fully understood. To better understand the effects of structural and microstructural changes of the heart and the vasculature on their proper functioning, a detailed characterization of the microstructure is crucial. In vivo imaging approaches are noninvasive and allow visualizing the heart and the vasculature in 3D. However, their spatial image resolution is often too limited for microstructural analyses, and hence, ex vivo imaging is preferred for this purpose. Ex vivo X-ray microfocus computed tomography (microCT) is a rapidly emerging high-resolution 3D structural imaging technique often used for the assessment of calcified tissues. Contrast-enhanced microCT (CE-CT) or phase-contrast microCT (PC-CT) improve this technique by additionally allowing the distinction of different low X-ray-absorbing soft tissues. In this review, we present the strengths of ex vivo microCT, CE-CT and PC-CT for quantitative 3D imaging of the structure and/or microstructure of the heart, the vasculature and their substructures in healthy and diseased state. We also discuss their current limitations, mainly with regard to the contrasting methods and the tissue preparation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Minipigs are well suited for oral research. First, the size\nof their oral apparatus is almost ideal for the use of standard\nclinical treatments for humans, for example dental implants.\nSecond, there are some remarkable convergences between\nall pigs of the genus Sus and higher primates in the form and\nfunction of the jaws, presumably the result of convergent\nadaptive evolution for an omnivorous diet. These similarities make the minipig the most relevant model for human\nfeeding outside of nonhuman primates.",
