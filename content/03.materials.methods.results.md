### Tomographic imaging

For this study, we imaged all samples with different Bruker SkyScan X-ray microcomputed tomography scanners (all from Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium).
An overview of the imaging and reconstruction parameters is given in the text below.
Imaging parameters are mentioned briefly below and summarized in detail in a table given in the [Supplementary Materials].

### Animal preparation and perfusion of contrast agent μAngiofil
The vasculature of all animals was instilled with the iodine-based contrast agent μAngiofil (Fumedica AG, Switzerland).

The contrast agent μAngiofil was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions by first combining the two components 'Contrast Solution' and 'PU'.
These pre-mixed components were then mixed with a hardener immediately before instillation into the cannulated vascular system of the animals.
Perfusion was conducted using a syringe pump to maintain consistent flow rates between 1 and 1.5 ml/min, ensuring reproducibility across experiments.

The perfusion of the animals was performed as previously described [@doi:10.1007/s00429-020-02158-8; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017].
Heparinized animals were deeply anesthetized (details on anesthezia for each animal model are given below).

For mice, the descending aorta was cannulated, and blood was flushed with PBS before perfusion with μAngiofil.
The exposed aorta was then cannulated in either antegrade (for the perfusion of the hind limbs) or retrograde direction (for the perfusion of the head and teeth) with a Venflon cannula (26 GA).
The perfusion lasted until the organ of interest appeared completely filled with the blue contrast agent [@doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017].
In bones, it is not possible to visually monitor this color change, thus perfusion of the neighboring soft tissues serves as an indirect marker of sufficient perfusion within the bone.
To achieve correct perfusion of the vessels within the bone, we prolonged the perfusion time by instilling at least 2 ml of extra volume of contrast agent after all the superficial tissues of the extremity or head turned blue.

For minipigs, the external carotid artery was cannulated, and perfusion was performed similarly.

#### Contrast-Enhanced microAngioCT of Murine Tibia

Here, one 21-month-old VEGF transgenic male mouse was anesthetized with a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg).
μAngiofil perfusion was performed as described above.
After μAngiofil polymerization, samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution at 4 °C and stored in PFA until tomographic imaging.

The samples was removed from the PFA solution, wrapped in closed-pore foam, and scanned in a custom-made sealed plastic sample holder under humid conditions using a SkyScan 1172.
Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 49 kV, a current of 200 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of [2.99] μm.
We acquired 7202 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, (4000 x 2672 px, 3 averaged to one, each exposed for 985 ms).

Figure @fig:1 shows the tibial bone microstructure and vascularization of a 21-month-old VEGF transgenic male mouse.
This visualization approach enables the simultaneous display of bone and its vascularization.
These tomographic datasets were also used in another study [@doi:10.1126/science.abc8479], where we performed simultaneous quantification of vasculature and bone volume.

  Arrowheads mark microvessels within the tibia.
  The diameter of the tibia shaft is around 1 mm.
  On the right side of the image, one can distinguish the bigger epiphyseal vessels.
  The bone tissue appears white at the plane of the virtual section through the microCT-dataset.](images/Fig1_murine_tibia.png){#fig:1}

#### Decalcification of the μAngiofil-perfused murine tibia

We established a bone decalcifying protocol using 10% ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) solution [@doi:10.1038/srep41842], adapted from previous work [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20720].

Decalcification reduces the X-ray absorption of bone tissue without negatively influencing bone structure.
However, this process renders the bone structure itself undetectable in tomographic imaging, preventing simultaneous visualization of bone and vasculature (Fig. @fig:2 B).

To evaluate the effects of decalcification, hind limbs of 10-week-old CB17SCID male mice were scanned before and after decalcification in 10% EDTA for 7 days.

Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 59 kV, a current of 167 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of 3.19 μm.
We acquired 1991 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 180°, (4000 x 2672 px, 2 averaged to one, each exposed for 1740 ms).

![**microAngioCT-based visualization of the diaphysis of CB17SCID mice tibia before (A & A') and after decalcification with 10% EDTA (B & B').**
  In A and A' the tibia bone appears brighter and opaque due to higher X-ray absorption.
  In B and B' the tibia bone appears transparent due to its lowered X-ray absorption after decalcification.
  Due to the decalcification, connecting vessels between the periosteal vessels and the vessels of the bone marrow cavity (bmc) are more easily detectable (blue arrows in A vs. B).
  The visualization of the vessels within the medullar cavity (*central sinus* (CS)) is also improved.
  At the external surface of the tibia, supplying arteries are visible (*arteria et vena nutricia* (avn)).
  The structure of the bone tissue is no longer clearly detectable after the decalcification (B-B’).](images/Fig2_Decalcification.png){#fig:2}

#### Bone Metastatic Disease Model

In bone metastatic disease models, simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature is crucial.
Since changes in bone and vasculature are believed to be of crucial importance for the progression of bone metastatic disease, decalcification is generally avoided in these studies.

To verify the suitability of our microAngioCT approach for imaging intratumoral vasculature in native, non-decalcified bone tissue we used the following murine bone metastatic disease model.
50000 PC3-M-Pro4Luc2 dTomato cells were injected into the tibia of 6-week-old CB17SCID male mice as previously described [@doi:10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-1220; @doi:10.1038/bonekey.2016.4].
The X-ray assessment (25 kV, 6 sec, Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, US) was conducted on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after implantation to monitor the progression of the lesions.
Before perfusion with μAngiofil (as described above), the hind limb of interest was X-rayed using Faxitron Bioptics as a standard follow-up in this model (see insert in Fig. @fig:3, Panel A).
The harvested and fixated murine hind limb (4 % PFA at 4 °C) was then imaged using a SkyScan 1272 (Fig. @fig:3).
Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 60 kV, a current of 166 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of 1.65 μm.
We acquired 1878 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 180°, (4904 x 3280 px, 3 averaged to one, each exposed for 2800 ms).
The visualization (CTvox (v.3.3.1), Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium) displays intratumoral vasculature and extensive defects in mineralized bone tissue.
Neighboring structures, such as the growth plate and the epiphysis or the menisci are also easily assessed (Fig. @fig:3).

#### Imaging of Murine Mandible and Teeth

C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized (with a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg)), and their head was perfused with μAngiofil.
The perfused head was harvested and fixed (4 % PFA at 4 °C).
Before tomographic imaging the mandible was excised, wrapped in a paper towel, and scanned in a sealed pipette tip.

The mouse teeth were imaged using a SkyScan 1172 (Fig. @fig:4).
Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 80 kV, a current of 124 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of 1 μm.
We acquired 3602 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, (4000 x 2672 px, 4 averaged to one, each exposed for 6260 ms).

For murine mandibles and teeth, decalcification is unnecessary due to the distinct X-ray attenuation properties of μAngiofil and bone tissue.
This allows clear visualization of the microvasculature of the vasculature within the mandible, periodontal ligament, and the teeth (even within their pulp chamber) without compromising bone structure (Fig. @fig:4).

#### Imaging of Minipig Mandible

Göttingen minipigs (Ellegaard Göttingen Minipig, Dalmose, Denmark) were anesthetized intramuscularly (25--35 mg/kg, Dexdomitor; Orion Pharma Animal Health and 50--70 mg/kg, Zoletil 100 Vet, Virbac) and intravenously heparinized with 300 IE/kg (Heparin LEO, LEO Pharma).
After heparin infusion, the pigs were euthanized with an intravenous dose (100 mg/kg) of pentobarbital (Euthanimal vet, VM Pharma).
The external carotid artery was accessed by blunt dissection through the tissue of the ventral neck and cannulated (BD Venflon, 17G).
After washing out the blood with PBS, the corresponding head side was selectively perfused with μAngiofil through the arterial tree.
Otherwise, the perfusion was performed with the same approach as in the previously described mice experiments.
After the polymerization of μAngiofil, we excised the mandible and fixated and stored it in 4 % PFA solution at 4 °C.

Mandibles were then scanned with a SkyScan 1273 (Fig. @fig:5).
Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 100 kV, a current of 80 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of 21 μm (panel A) or 9 μm (panels B and C).
For the visualization shown in panel A, we recorded 3601 projection images over a sample rotation of 360° (3072 x 1944 px, 5 averaged to one, each exposed for 225 ms).
For the visualizations shown in panels B and C, we recorded 2401 projection images over a sample rotation of 360° (5 averaged to one, each exposed for 225 ms).
In addition, two horizontally overlapping projections were stitched to one projection with a size of 4832 x 1944 px to increase the imaged sample volume and cover the full extent of the sample.

  The vasculature at the bone surface is visible.
  The framed area in A marks the subvolume represented in panel B at higher magnification.
  Panel C displays the transverse section marked in panel B, clearly showing the pulp chamber, root canal, and the corresponding vessels.
  Due to the voxel size of 8--9 μm, microvessels with a diameter of 40 μm or less cannot be visualized in such large samples.](images/Fig5_Vreni_jaw_minipig.png){#fig:5}

Angiogenesis influences the osseointegration of implants.
As such, studying angiogenesis and, correspondingly the vascular supply of the peri-implant tissue in detail is important for dental research and many implantology studies.
So far, the only reliable approach to assess the vascular supply remains histology, limited to single two-dimensional sections.

While microCT imaging allows for non-destructive, full 3D imaging of dental research samples with implants, such imaging presents challenges.
This is due to the presence of high-density metal parts with strong X-ray absorption within the samples.
To distinguish the vasculature from both the metal implants and the mineralized bone tissue, we instilled the vasculature with a suitable contrast agent (μAngiofil).
The X-ray absorption characteristics of μAngiofil make it possible to visualize and differentiate between soft tissue, bone tissue, contrast agent-filled vessels and metal (titanium) implants.
We imaged an μAngiofil-instilled minipig hemimandibula with a SkyScan 2214 (Fig. @fig:6), 
Imaging parameters included an acceleration voltage of 100 kV, a current of 100 μA, and an isotropic voxel size of 8 μm.
We acquired 2001 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, (2929 x 1944 px, 4 averaged to one, each exposed for 1080 ms).

In the resulting tomographic datasets these regions of interest can easily be distinguished based on their gray value ranges, as shown in Fig. @fig:6, Panel C.
Tomographic imaging of such samples and straightforward segmentation of features of interest without cumbersome post-processing (Fig. @fig:6, Panel D) is enabled without requiring a decalcification step.

  Corresponding peaks with color legend are marked on the histogram in panel C.
  Such differences in gray levels allow a straightforward segmentation of the structures of interest as displayed in the 3D visualization in panel D.](images/Fig6_Segmentation.png){#fig:6}
  
#### Dual-Energy microAngioCT

Unfortunately, not all samples exhibit a pronounced difference in gray values between bone tissue and μAngiofil when scanned using standard scanning parameters.
This issue is particularly common in murine samples, even though the bone mineral density of mouse bones is generally higher than that of other experimental species [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004; @doi:10.1292/jvms.66.599].
In tompgraphic datasets of murine samples, the gray values of bone tissue and μAngiofil are similar making it impossible to distinguish them based on histogram levels alone (e.g., Fig. @fig:4).
While decalcification can improve contrast (see Fig. @fig:2), we propose an efficient alternative, more efficient solution: dual-energy scanning.
Previous studies have demonstrated that microscopic dual-energy CT imaging (microDECT) using commercial lab-based microCT systems can achieve spectral separation of two or more materials with micrometer resolution [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12543; @doi:10.1111/jmi.13369].
Notably, the contrasting properties of hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in bone and teeth) and iodine (the high-Z component in μAngiofil) make them ideal for spectral X-ray imaging [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12543; @doi:10.1007/s13244-010-0057-0; @doi:10.1118/1.594374].

We evaluated multiple energies (accelerating voltages from 40 to 110 kV) to choose the optimal combination for imaging of the murine mandible perfused with μAngiofil using a SkyScan 2214 (Fig. @fig:7).
The optimal dual-energy settings for the X-ray source were 50 kV/120 μA and 90 kV/100 μA, respectively (acceleration voltage/source current).
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, acquiring one projection every 0.1°, with 7 projections averaged for noise reduction.
We acquired 3601 projection images, recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, (4032 x 2688 px, 7 averaged to one, each exposed for 4550 ms).
This resulted in datasets with an isotropic voxel size of 1.4 μm.

In comparison to 50 kV, at 90 kV the gray value of the bone tissue was decreased and the gray value of μAngiofil increased (Fig. @fig:7 C’).
By using different X-ray energies, this method enhances contrast between bone and μAngiofil without compromising bone structure, enabling straightforward segmentation based on the combined histogram (Fig. @fig:7 C’’).

![**Dual-energy segmentation of murine mandible vasculature.**
  Panel A and B represent virtual sections through the microCT datasets obtained at different accelerating voltages: 50 kV (A) and 90 kV (B).
  The dashed red line in panels A and B represents the location of the corresponding intensity profile displayed in panels A’ and B’.
  Panel C highlights the vasculature which is segmented with using the dual-energy approach in red.
  The changes in the intensity profiles of different tissues are shown in graph C’: with the higher voltage (90 kV) the intensity of bone tissue reduces (yellow arrow) and the intensity of vessels (μAngiofil) increases.
  Such changes in gray levels allow segmentation of the vessels using the combined histogram shown in panel C’’ (DEhist, Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium).
  Panel D represents a three-dimensional visualization of the segmented tissues (Dragonfly 3D World (2024.1), Comet Technologies Canada Inc., Montréal, Canada).](images/Fig7_DualEnergy.png){#fig:7}
