## Materials, Methods and Results {.page_break_before}

### Animals

Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the applicable Swedish, Israeli or Swiss legislation on the protection of animals and were approved by the corresponding committees.
In this study we used one transgenic VEGF male 21 months old mouse (see (Grunewald et al., 2021) for more details), five 6 weeks old CB17SCID male mice and two Göttingen minipigs.

### Contrast-enhanced microangioCT of mice using µAngiofil

The contrast agent µAngiofil has been prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Fumedica AG, Switzerland).
The perfusion of the mice was performed as previously described (Hlushchuk et al., 2020, Hlushchuk et al., 2018).
Briefly, heparinized animals were deeply anaesthetized, the thorax and the peritoneal cavity were opened with scissors to expose the descending aorta.
The exposed aorta was then cannulated in either antegrade (for the perfusion of the hind limbs) or retrograde direction (for the perfusion of the head and teeth) with a Venflon cannula (26 GA).
Afterwards, the blood was flushed out with warm PBS solution until the body part of interest turned completely pale.
Three to four cuts of the liver edge allowed effusion of the blood and buffer solution.
Thereafter, the corresponding (upper or lower) part of the body was perfused with µAngiofil at 1-1.5 ml/min using a syringe pump.
The perfusion lasted until the organ of interest turned completely blue (Hlushchuk et al., 2019, Hlushchuk et al., 2018).
In bones, it is not possible to visually monitor the described color change.
Correct perfusion of the neighboring soft tissues serves as an indirect marker of the perfusion within the bone.
Therefore, to achieve a good perfusion of the vessels within the bone, the perfusion time was significantly prolonged (at least 2 ml extra volume of contrast agent after all the superficial tissues of the extremity or head turned blue).
Such a prolonged perfusion protocol ensured adequate perfusion of the bones of murine hind limbs (Fig.
1).
After harvesting, the samples were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and then scanned using microCT scanners (Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium).
Figure 1 shows the bone microstructure and vascularization of a tibia of a 21-month-old VEGF transgenic male mouse.
This visualization approach enabled a simultaneous display of bone, its vascularization, and their segmentation.
Therefore, as presented in our other study, using the obtained datasets we could quantitatively show that the age-related osteoporosis diminishes with improved vascularization (Grunewald et al., 2021).

### Decalcification of the µAngiofil-perfused murine tibia

It is practically the standard in the field to decalcify the bone samples to enable the proper visualization and segmentation of vasculature within bone tissue (Nunez et al., 2017, Roche et al., 2012).
Based on published data (Schneider et al., 2009), we were successful in establishing a bone-decalcifying protocol (for murine hind limb) with 10% EDTA solution (Schaad et al., 2017).
Such a decalcification step does not seem to negatively influence the bone structure as such but reduces the X-ray absorption of bone tissue and renders it impossible to visualize it simultaneously with the vasculature (Fig.
2).
On the other hand, it enables tomographic imaging of the murine hind limb vasculature with less artefacts around the bone at significantly lower acceleration voltage.
In most instances it leads to remarkably shorter scanning times.
Furthermore, segmentation of the vasculature in the tomographic datasets becomes easier and a subsequent histological evaluation of the sample is facilitated by such a decalcification step (Schaad et al., 2017).

  Due to higher X-ray absorption the tibia bone appears brighter and non-transparent in A & A'.
  In B & B' it is transparent due to its lower X-ray absorption after decalcification.
  As a result, the connecting vessels between the periostal vessels and the vessels of the bone marrow cavity (bmc) are easily detectable (blue arrows in A & B).
  The visualization of the vessels within the medullar cavity (*central sinus* (CS)) is also improved.
  At the external surface of the tibia, supplying arteries are visible (*arteria et vena nutricia* (avn)).

### Bone metastatic disease model, microangioCT

Assessment as well as 3D imaging of the tumor vasculature is always a challenging task, in almost every tumor model (Hlushchuk et al., 2016).
A bone metastatic disease model is even more challenging for 3D microvascular imaging, due to the intraosseous location of tumor lesions.
Since the changes in bone and vasculature are believed to be of crucial importance for the progression of bone metastatic disease, simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature is crucial.
The desire to also simultaneously assess existing bone defects makes a decalcification procedure, as suggested above, extremely disadvantageous.
To verify the suitability of our microangioCT approach for this kind of experimental imaging we used the following murine tumor model.

### Murine bone metastatic disease model

In the bone metastatic disease model, 50000 PC3-M-Pro4Luc2 dTomato cells were injected into the tibia of 6 weeks old CB17SCID male mice as previously described (Zoni et al., 2019, Dai et al., 2016).
The X-ray (25 kV, 6 sec) assessment (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, US) was conducted at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after implantation to monitor the progression of the lesions.
Animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland (permit number BE 55/16) and carried out in accordance with Swiss Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Prior to terminal anesthesia and perfusion with µAngiofil, the hind limb of interest was X-rayed using Faxitron Bioptics as a standard follow-up in this model (see insert in Fig.
3A).
The harvested and fixated murine hind limb was then scanned using a desktop microCT scanner SKYSCAN 1272 (Fig.
3).
The obtained dataset was reconstructed using NRecon Software v.1.7.4.2 (microCT Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) and visualized using CTvox Software v.3.3.1 (microCT Bruker, Kontich, Belgium).
The visualization unambiguously displayed the intratumoral vasculature and extensive defects in the mineralized bone tissue.
The neighboring structures, such as the growth plate, the epiphysis or the menisci are also easily assessed (Fig.
3).

### MicroangioCT of murine mandible/teeth 

Murine mandibles and teeth are challenging samples due to the location of most of the vessels within the bone canals or in the proximity of the hard tissue and, correspondingly, the lack of larger bone-free volumes in which the vessels are easily distinguishable.
Nonetheless, with the improved perfusion protocol (see above) and a well visualized difference between the X-ray absorption levels of µAngiofil and mineralized bone tissue, we achieved appropriate imaging of the sample.
The microvasculature of murine mandible, periodontal ligament, and the teeth (even within their pulp chamber) can be clearly visualized without undergoing a decalcification procedure (Fig.
4).

### MicroangioCT of mandible in a large animal model (Göttingen Minipig)

Due to their similarity to humans in terms of anatomy, bone structure and bone remodeling, the Göttingen Minipig has become a well-accepted large animal model in preclinical dental and orofacial research (Wang et al., 2007, Pearce et al., 2007, Herring et al., 2011).
The stricter legal requirements regarding primates and the societal resistance against the use of companion animals, such as dogs and cats, have further enhanced the usage of Göttingen minipigs as animal models (Pearce et al., 2007).

Göttingen minipigs (Ellegaard Göttingen Minipig, Dalmose, Denmark) held under license 5.8.18-15672/2019 approved by the Malmö/Lund regional ethical committee, Sweden, were intramuscularly anesthetized (25-35 mg/kg, Dexdomitor; Orion Pharma Animal Health and 50-70 mg/kg, Zoletil 100 Vet, Virbac) and heparinized with 300 IE/kg intravenously (Heparin LEO, LEO Pharma).
After heparin infusion, the pigs were euthanized with an intravenous dose (100 mg/kg) of pentobarbital (Euthanimal vet, VM Pharma).
*A.
carotis externa* was accessed by blunt dissection through tissue of the ventral neck and cannulated (BD Venflon, 17G).
After washing out the blood with PBS, the corresponding head side was selectively perfused with µAngiofil through the arterial tree.
The success of the perfusion has been visually controlled equivalent to the previously described perfusion in mice.
After polymerization of µAngiofil (\~30 min), the mandible was excised and fixated in 4% PFA solution.
They were later scanned using SKYSCAN 2214 or SKYSCAN 1273, and the datasets reconstructed and visualized using NRecon v.1.7.4.2 and CTvox Software v.3.3.1, correspondingly (both microCT Bruker, Kontich, Belgium).
Our approach provides excellent imaging of the whole mandible vasculature down to the vessels within the root canals and pulp chamber (Fig.
5).

  Due to the voxel size of 8-9 µm, the microvessels with diameter of approx. 40 µm or less cannot be visualized in such large samples.](images/Fig5_Vreni jaw minipig.png){#fig:5}

As already mentioned, the Göttingen Minipig has become a very popular large animal model in dental research and is often used also for implantology studies.
After researchers in the field realized that osseointegration is influenced by angiogenesis, there is understanding that angiogenesis and, correspondingly, vascular supply of the peri-implant tissue should be assessed as thoroughly as possible and preferably in 3D.
So far, the only reliable approach to assess the vascular supply remains histology, which is limited to single two-dimensional sections.
Based on the findings in those single histological sections, researchers try to assess the vascularization of the peri-implant bone.
Even for the microCT approach, it is a challenging task due to the presence of metal parts and, therefore, multiple objects with high density within the samples.
The decalcification step could reduce the density of the sample but would inevitably lead to the loss of information on the bone microstructure making the simultaneous assessment of the bone and vessels impossible (Nunez et al., 2017).
Another obstacle is to have a contrast agent that can be distinctly separated from both the metal implants and the mineralized tissue.
With µAngiofil it is easily possible to visualize and distinguish between soft tissue, bone tissue, contrast agent-filled vessels as well as metal implants according to their gray values in the histogram (Fig.
6).
Such imaging does not require bone decalcification and enables a rather straightforward segmentation of features of interest without cumbersome post-processing (Fig.
6D).

  Structures with distinguishably different grey values are marked with colored circles -- see the histogram distribution and corresponding peaks with colors legend in panel C.
  Such differences in grey levels allow a straightforward segmentation of the structures of interest as displayed in panel D.
