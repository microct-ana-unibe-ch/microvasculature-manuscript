## Materials, Methods, and Results {.page_break_before}

### Animals

In this study, we used one transgenic VEGF male 21 months old mouse (see @doi:10.1126/science.abc8479 for more details), 6 weeks old CB17SCID male mice, 12 weeks old C57BL/6 mice, and two Göttingen minipigs.
Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the applicable Swedish, Israeli, or Swiss legislation on the protection of animals and were approved by the corresponding committees.

Murine experiments were approved by the local Swiss ethical committee (Tierversuchskommission des Kantons Bern, Amt für Veterinärwesen, Bern, Switzerland) under the permit number BE 55/16.
Minipig experiments were approved by the Malmö/Lund Ethics Committee on Animal Testing at the Lund District Court, Sweden under license 5.8.18-15672/2019.

### Contrast-enhanced microangioCT of mice using μAngiofil

The contrast agent μAngiofil (Fumedica AG, Switzerland) was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
The perfusion of the mice was performed as previously described [@doi:10.1007/s00429-020-02158-8; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017].
Heparinized animals were deeply anesthetized, and the thorax and the peritoneal cavity were opened with scissors to expose the descending aorta.
The exposed aorta was then cannulated in either antegrade (for the perfusion of the hind limbs) or retrograde direction (for the perfusion of the head and teeth) with a Venflon cannula (26 GA).
Afterwards, the blood was flushed out with a warm PBS solution.
Several cuts of the liver edge allowed for effusion of the blood and buffer solution.
Thereafter, the selected part of the body (hind limbs or head and teeth) was perfused with μAngiofil at 1--1.5 ml/min using a syringe pump.
The perfusion lasted until the organ of interest appeared completely blue [@doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017].
In bones, it is not possible to visually monitor this color change, thus perfusion of the neighboring soft tissues serves as an indirect marker of sufficient perfusion within the bone.
To achieve correct perfusion of the vessels within the bone, we prolonged the perfusion time by instilling at least 2 ml of extra volume of contrast agent after all the superficial tissues of the extremity or head turned blue.
After μAngiofil polymerization we fixed the samples in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution at 4° C and stored them in PFA until tomographic imaging.
Samples were then imaged using a SKYSCAN 1172 (Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium).
For imaging, the samples were removed from the PFA solution, wrapped in closed-pore foam, and scanned in a custom-made sealed plastic sample holder in a wet atmosphere.
This scan was performed on a SKYSCAN 1172 with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 49 kV and an X-ray source current of 200 μA.
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, with one projection acquired at each 0.05° and 3 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image with a size of 4000 x 2672 pixels was exposed for 985 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 2.99 μm.
All scanning and reconstruction parameters for each dataset shown in each figure are given in the [Supplementary Materials].

This visualization approach enables a simultaneous display of bone and its vascularization.
These tomographic datasets were also used in another study [@doi:10.1126/science.abc8479], where we performed simultaneous quantification of vasculature and bone volume.

### Decalcification of the μAngiofil-perfused murine tibia

We successfully established a bone-decalcifying protocol (for murine hind limb) with 10% ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) solution [@doi:10.1038/srep41842] by adapting previous work [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20720].

Decalcification of bone tissue does not negatively influence the bone structure itself, but reduces the X-ray absorption of bone tissue and thus makes it impossible to visualize it simultaneously with the vasculature (Fig. @fig:2 B).

As described above, we instilled the lower body of 6 weeks old CB17SCID male mice with μAngiofil.
Following polymerization of the contrast agent, the hind limbs were collected, fixed in 4% PFA, and stored in PFA until scanning.
After an initial tomographic scan, the hind limbs were decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 7 days, followed by a second tomographic scan of the sample.

These samples were imaged with a SKYSCAN 1172, with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 59 kV and an X-ray source current of 167 μA.
The X-rays were filtered by 0.25 mm of aluminum.
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 180°, with one projection acquired at each 0.1° and 2 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image with a size of 4000 x 2672 pixels was exposed for 1740 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 3.19 μm.

![**microangioCT-based visualization of the diaphysis of CB17SCID mice tibia before (A & A') and after decalcification with 10% EDTA (B & B').**
  In A and A' the tibia bone appears brighter and opaque due to higher X-ray absorption.
  In B and B' the tibia bone appears transparent due to its lowered X-ray absorption after decalcification.
  Due to the decalcification, connecting vessels between the periosteal vessels and the vessels of the bone marrow cavity (bmc) are more easily detectable (blue arrows in A vs. B).
  The visualization of the vessels within the medullar cavity (*central sinus* (CS)) is also improved.
  At the external surface of the tibia, supplying arteries are visible (*arteria et vena nutricia* (avn)).
  The structure of the bone tissue is no more clearly detectable after the decalcification (B-B’).](images/Fig2_Decalcification.png){#fig:2}

### Bone metastatic disease model, microangioCT

As mentioned in the introduction, simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature is crucial in a bone metastatic disease model.
Since changes in bone and vasculature are believed to be of crucial importance for the progression of bone metastatic disease, decalcifying the bone tissue is highly unfavorable.

To verify the suitability of our microangioCT approach for imaging intratumoral vasculature in native, non-decalcified bone tissue we used the following murine bone metastatic disease model.
50000 PC3-M-Pro4Luc2 dTomato cells were injected into the tibia of 6-week-old CB17SCID male mice as previously described [@doi:10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-1220; @doi:10.1038/bonekey.2016.4].
The X-ray assessment (25 kV, 6 sec, Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, US) was conducted at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after implantation to monitor the progression of the lesions.
Before terminal anesthesia and perfusion with μAngiofil as described above, the hind limb of interest was X-rayed using Faxitron Bioptics as a standard follow-up in this model (see insert in Fig. @fig:3, Panel A).
The harvested and fixated murine hind limb (4% PFA at 4° C) was then imaged using a desktop microCT scanner SKYSCAN 1272 (Fig. @fig:3), with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 60 kV and an X-ray source current of 166 μA.
The X-rays were filtered by 0.25 mm of aluminum.
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 180°, with one projection acquired at each 0.1° and 3 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image with a size of 4904 x 3280 pixels was exposed for 2800 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 1.65 μm.

The visualization (CTvox (v.3.3.1), Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium) displays intratumoral vasculature and extensive defects in mineralized bone tissue.
Neighboring structures, such as the growth plate and the epiphysis or the menisci are also easily assessed (Fig. @fig:3).

### microangioCT of murine mandible and teeth

C57BL/6 mice were terminally anesthetized, and their head was perfused with μAngiofil as described above.
The perfused head was harvested and fixed (4% PFA at 4° C).
Before tomographic imaging the mandible was excised, wrapped in a paper towel, and scanned in a sealed pipette tip.
The mouse teeth were imaged using a desktop microCT scanner SKYSCAN 1172 (Fig. @fig:4), with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 80 kV and an X-ray source current of 124 μA.
The X-rays were filtered by 0.5 mm of aluminum.
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, with one projection acquired at each 0.1° and 4 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image with a size of 4000 x 2672 pixels was exposed for 6260 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 1 μm.

The microvasculature of murine mandible, periodontal ligament, and the teeth (even within their pulp chamber) can be clearly visualized without undergoing a decalcification procedure (Fig. @fig:4).

### microangioCT of the mandible in a large animal model (Göttingen Minipig)

Göttingen minipigs (Ellegaard Göttingen Minipig, Dalmose, Denmark) were anesthetized intramuscularly (25--35 mg/kg, Dexdomitor; Orion Pharma Animal Health and 50--70 mg/kg, Zoletil 100 Vet, Virbac) and intravenously heparinized with 300 IE/kg (Heparin LEO, LEO Pharma).
After heparin infusion, the pigs were euthanized with an intravenous dose (100 mg/kg) of pentobarbital (Euthanimal vet, VM Pharma).
The external carotid artery was accessed by blunt dissection through tissue of the ventral neck and cannulated (BD Venflon, 17G).
After washing out the blood with PBS, the corresponding head side was selectively perfused with μAngiofil through the arterial tree.
Otherwise, the perfusion was performed with the same approach as in the previously described mice experiments.
After polymerization of μAngiofil we excised the mandible and fixated and stored it in 4% PFA solution at 4° C.

Mandibles were then scanned with a SKYSCAN 1273 (Fig. @fig:5).
The scans were performed with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 100 kV and an X-ray source current of 80 μA.
The X-rays were filtered by 1 mm of aluminum and 0.2 mm of copper.
For the visualization shown in panel A, we recorded projection images with a size of 3072 x 1944 pixels over a sample rotation of 360°, with one projection acquired at each 0.1° and 5 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image was exposed for 225 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 21 μm.
For the visualizations shown in panels B and C, the sample was rotated over totally 360° with one projection acquired at each 0.15° and 5 projections were averaged.
In addition, two horizontally overlapping projections were stitched to one projection with a size of 4832 x 1944 px to increase the imaged sample volume.
Each projection image was exposed for 225 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 9 μm.

  Panel C displays the transverse section marked in panel B: the pulp chamber and root canal with the corresponding vessels are unambiguously visualized.
  Due to the voxel size of 8--9 μm, microvessels with diameter of 40 μm or less cannot be visualized in such large samples.](images/Fig5_Vreni jaw minipig.png){#fig:5}

Osseointegration of implants is influenced by angiogenesis.
As such, studying angiogenesis and, correspondingly the vascular supply of the peri-implant tissue in detail is important for dental research and many implantology studies.
So far, the only reliable approach to assess the vascular supply remains histology, limited to single two-dimensional sections.

While microCT imaging allows for non-destructive, fully 3D imaging of dental research samples with implants, such imaging is a challenging task due to the presence of these metal parts with high density and X-ray absorption within the samples.
A decalcification step reduces the density of the sample but inevitably leads to the loss of information on the bone microstructure making the simultaneous assessment of the bone and vessels impossible [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
For distinguishing the vasculature from both the metal implants and the mineralized bone tissue, we instilled the vasculature with a suitable contrast agent (μAngiofil).
The X-ray absorption characteristics of μAngiofil make it possible to visualize and differentiate between soft tissue, bone tissue, contrast agent-filled vessels as well as metal (titanium) implants.
We imaged an μAngiofil-instilled minipig hemimandibula with a SKYSCAN 2214 (Fig. @fig:6), with an X-ray source acceleration voltage of 100 kV and an X-ray source current of 100 μA.
The X-rays were filtered by 1 mm of copper.
Projection images were recorded over a sample rotation of 360°, with one projection acquired at each 0.18° and 4 projections being averaged for noise reduction.
Each projection image with a size of 2929 x 1944 pixels was exposed for 1080 ms.
This resulted in an isometric voxel size of 8 μm.

In the resulting tomographic datasets these regions of interest can easily be distinguished based on their gray value ranges, as shown in Fig. @fig:6, Panel C.
Tomographic imaging of such samples and straightforward segmentation of features of interest without cumbersome post-processing (Fig. @fig:6, Panel D) is enabled without requiring a decalcification step.

  Panel B: virtual transversal section through the dataset showing an implant within the mandible.
  The colored circles mark structures with different gray values ranges.
  Corresponding peaks with color legend are marked on the histogram in panel C.
  Such differences in gray levels allow a straightforward segmentation of the structures of interest as displayed in the 3D visualization in panel D.](images/Fig6_Segmentation.png){#fig:6}

Unfortunately, not all the samples display such a pronounced difference between the gray values of bone tissue and μAngiofil when scanned under standard scanning parameters.
It is often the case especially in the murine samples, while the bone mineral density of mouse bones is generally higher than in other experimental species [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004; @doi:10.1292/jvms.66.599].
It results in similar gray levels of bone tissue and μAngiofil rendering their distinction based on histogram levels impossible (e.g., Fig. @fig:4).
Although decalcification may be helpful (see Fig. @fig:2), there is another approach which we believe is more efficient – dual-energy scanning.
It has been demonstrated previously that microscopic dual energy CT imaging (microDECT) using commercial lab-based microCT setups can achieve a spectral separation of two or three materials at micron resolution [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12543].
Importantly, hydroxyapatite (the mineral in bone and teeth) versus iodine (the high-Z component in μAngiofil) offer optimal properties for spectral X-Ray imaging [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12543; @doi:10.1007/s13244-010-0057-0; @doi:10.1118/1.594374].

We evaluated multiple energies (accelerating voltages from 40 to 110 kV) to choose the optimal combination for imaging of the murine mandible perfused with μAngiofil using out multiscale scanner SkyScan 2214 (Fig. @fig:7).
For our scanner the optimal combination was 50 kV and 90 kV: in comparison to 50 kV, at 90 kV the gray value of the bone tissue was decreased and the gray value of μAngiofil increased (Fig. @fig:7 C’).
Such changes allow a non-complicated segmentation of bone and μAngiofil based on the combined histogram (Fig. @fig:7 C’’).

![**Dual energy microangioCT of a murine mandibula.**
  Panel A and B represent virtual sections through the microCT datasets obtained at different accelerating voltages: 50 kV (A) and 90 kV (B).
  The dashed red line in panels A and B represents the location of the corresponding intensity profile displayed in panels A’ and B’.
  Panel C represents segmented vasculature using the dual energy approach.
  The changes in the intensity profiles of different tissues are shown in graph C’: with the higher voltage (90 kV) the intensity of bone tissue reduces (yellow arrow) and the intensity of vessels (μAngiofil) increases.
  Such changes in gray levels allow a segmentation of the vessels using the combined histogram shown in panel C’’ (DEhist, Bruker microCT N.V., Kontich, Belgium).
  Panel D represents a three-dimensional visualization of the segmented tissues (Dragonfly 3D World (2024.1), Comet Technologies Canada Inc., Montréal, Canada).](images/Fig7_DualEnergy.png){#fig:7}
