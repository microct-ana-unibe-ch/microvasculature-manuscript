## Discussion {.page_break_before}

Adequate vascularization is essential for successful bone formation, regeneration, and osseointegration of biomaterials [@doi:10.1021/acsabm.1c00979; @doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2020.0132; @doi:10.1242/dev.136861; @doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1042/CS20180155]. Without high-resolution imaging, studying the interplay between vasculature and bone tissue is challenging, making it difficult to control these processes.

Non-destructive microCT imaging is widely considered the only viable method for 3D imaging of an intact bone-implant interface [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578].
To accurately differentiate vasculature from other soft tissue structures, using a contrast agent or creating a vascular replica is essential.

Our presented imaging method, involving instillation with μAngiofil, addresses several limitations of previously described techniques (see Introduction).
This approach enables visualization of both bone tissue and its vasculature, with or without prior decalcification (see Fig. @fig:2).

Established decalcifying protocols allow for correlative imaging of the same sample with preserved intravascular contrast agent, followed by classical histological evaluation [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].
This decalcification step reduces artifacts around the bone at lower X-ray source acceleration voltages due to the sample's reduced radiopacity, often allowing shorter scanning times and higher sample throughput.
Furthermore, decalcification aids in threshold-based segmentation of the vasculature and facilitates histological evaluation [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].
However, it renders bone tissue transparent, preventing simultaneous 3D imaging of bony and vascular structures.

In many models, due to distinct differences in X-ray attenuation between μAngiofil and bone tissue, we can skip the time-consuming decalcification step.
This allows direct assessment of vascularization and bone growth based on a single microCT scan (Fig. @fig:6).
Although finding optimal scanning parameters may require expertise and machine time, the single scan approach is generally efficient.
However, it does not always yield optimal results (e.g., Fig. @fig:4) and may lead to difficulties with segmentation and subsequent image analysis.
Based on our experience, distinctive imaging of various sample components is crucial for further analysis.
In such cases, a dual-energy scanning technique may offer a more efficient solution (see Fig. @fig:7).
Conducting two sequential scans at different energies without removing the sample simplifies dataset registration for the dual-energy approach.
This avoids the time-consuming decalcification step and provides simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature while keeping the sample intact.

One noteworthy application of the microangioCT approach is the simultaneous visualization of bone microarchitecture and microvasculature of bone metastases in a murine xenograft tumor model (Fig. @fig:3).
For studying bone metastatic models, it is crucial to find a method that allows correct assessment of the microvasculature without decalcifying the sample.
Decalcification would hinder the thorough assessment of pathological processes in bone tissue, which can cause skeletal-related events associated with shortened survival and deteriorated quality of life [@doi:10.1016/j.jbo.2018.10.004].
Our method enables assessment of blood vessel responses to treatments such as antiangiogenic therapy or bone regeneration strategies in 3D within the same sample, followed by histological examination if desired [@doi:10.3390/cancers14143443].
This method could offer additional insights into the interplay between angiogenesis, bone growth, bone lysis, and bone turnover, which have not been fully elucidated.
Potential findings are crucial for selecting drug candidates, making treatment decisions, and predicting efficacy.

In dental research, preclinical models can be divided into small and large animals.
Small animal models, particularly mice and rats, are highly popular due to their practical size and cost-effectiveness.
MicroCT scans of small samples perfused with μAngiofil can be performed with a voxel size of around 1 μm, providing excellent detail resolution (see Fig. @fig:4).
Murine mandibles and teeth present challenges for assessing vasculature due to most vessels being within bone canals or near hard tissue, leading to a lack of larger bone-free volumes where vasculature is easily distinguishable.
Gray value-based segmentation of bone and contrast-agent-instilled vasculature is compounded by the higher mineral bone density in murine bone compared to other species [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004; @doi:10.1292/jvms.66.599].
Nonetheless, with the dual-energy approach described above, we achieved appropriate imaging of such samples and visualized and distinguished vasculature within and from mineralized bone tissue.

Further work, also from our group, and ongoing research is focusing on improving the segmentation of vasculature in microtomographic datasets.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for vascular segmentation [@doi:10.2144/btn-2020-0108].
Specifically, the U-Net architecture of CNNs seems very promising for vascular segmentation tasks and has been applied for the segmentation of murine vascular networks [@doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.320672] and to high-resolution (~20 µm voxel size) tomographic datasets of intact human organs [@doi:10.1038/s41598-024-77582-5].
While neural network-based segmentation methods have shown promising results, the scarcity of annotated public datasets poses a challenge for training robust models and developing models that can generalize across different tissues, modalities, scales, and pathologies remains an active area of investigation.

In the small animal model studies without metal or similar biomedical implants, the application of whole mouse clearing and imaging with the vDISCO approach could be the method of choice [@doi:10.1038/s41596-022-00788-2].
Another promising improvement to the clearing protocols and immunolabeling of the samples with the bone tissue is the introduction of the collagenase digestion step, which improves the antibody penetration throughout the stained bones and, therefore, the immunostaining [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.031].
Although newer tissue clearing and immunostaining immersion-based visualization techniques provide high-resolution, three-dimensional images of intact samples, these methods may produce artifacts such as tissue deformation and illumination inhomogeneity [@doi:10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100151].

The presence of implanted biomedical devices further complicates the imaging process.
For murine model studies, a recently published tissue-clearing-based imaging approach [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] could be a viable option for the visualization of the peri-implant tissues and vasculature due to the small size of hemimandible samples and the availability of transgenic mouse lines.
However, there are limitations to such a tissue-clearing imaging approach.
Namely:
  i) differential shrinkage among soft and hard tissues, leading to anisotropic distortion in samples where both tissue types (plus any potential metal implant) are present;
  ii) limited imaging depth (approximately 800 μm in a mouse model [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578]) due to the challenges of achieving complete transparency of bone tissue.
Significant anisotropic distortion in the sample may alter the implant-tissue interface, a common site of interest.
The limitation of the maximal achievable imaging depth makes such an approach impractical for use in large animal models.

Our presented microangioCT approach does not have such limitations and can be easily applied for visualization of hemimandible and its vascularization in a large animal model like Göttingen minipig (Fig. @fig:5).
Iodine-based μAngiofil exhibits significantly different attenuation properties than mineralized bone in most species and allows for the distinction, segmentation, and visualization of soft tissue, bone tissue, vessels filled with the contrast agent, and metal implants according to their gray values in the histogram (see Fig. @fig:6).

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate non-destructive 3D imaging of the microvasculature of bone in the proximity of metal objects/implants in a large animal model.

While this study primarily focused on qualitative visualization of vascular structures, we acknowledge the importance of quantitative analyses.
Future work will incorporate metrics such as vessel diameter, connectivity, and perfusion efficiency to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of µAngiofil's performance.

### Limitations of our approach

Achieving the excellent results demonstrated in this study requires reproducible and controlled instillation of the contrast agent, which should be performed by skilled personnel using a syringe pump.

The method we presented for investigating microvasculature within bone tissue is primarily limited by the imaging technique, specifically the correlation between achievable resolution and the physical size of the imaged sample.
For small samples a few millimeters in diameter, voxel sizes on the order of 1 μm enable visualization of the microvasculature down to the capillary bed [@doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1007/s00429-020-02158-8; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017; @doi:10.1038/srep41842].
However, for larger samples like the minipig hemimandible, the achievable voxel size is approximately 10 times larger (≥8 μm), making it difficult to accurately visualize the finest microvessels with diameters under 40 μm (see Fig. @fig:5 & @fig:6).

Beyond the inherent limitations of tomographic imaging, instilling the vasculature in bone tissue with a polymerizing contrast agent represents a significant advancement in biomedical X-ray imaging.
This innovative method holds great promise for addressing key questions in tissue engineering, implantology, and related research fields.
