## Discussion {.page_break_before}

There is an understanding in the bone biology, tissue engineering and related research fields, that adequate vascularization is a prerequisite for successful bone formation and regeneration as well as osseointegration of biomaterials (Li et al., 2022, Schott et al., 2021, Sivaraj and Adams, 2016, Wernike et al., 2010, Chandra and Atala, 2019).
To influence or even control these processes, the interplay between vascular and bone tissue should be studied at the most detailed imaging level available.

During the last decades, microCT gained recognition as a non-destructive 3D imaging technique for bone morphology (Harrison and Cooper, 2015), and is considered the only available approach for 3D imaging of an intact bone-implant interface (Yi et al., 2019).
Unfortunately, the microCT-based distinction of the vessels from other soft tissue structures is not possible without intravascular casting or instillation of contrast agents.
Moreover, although enabling the visualization of the vasculature, most such casting or contrast agents are difficult to distinguish from the non-demineralized bone tissue due to the lack of remarkable differences in their X-ray absorption levels (Young et al., 2008)\.
For example, in case with Microfil, the mentioned lack of contrast requires decalcification of the samples before the bone vasculature can be properly visualized with a microCT scanner (Nunez et al., 2017, Young et al., 2008).
Some studies have described that barium sulfate suspension could be used for direct simultaneous imaging of vasculature and bone (Schneider et al., 2009, Qiu et al., 2016).
Many studies report higher viscosity of this agent in comparison to Microfil or µAngiofil, though which leads to inconsistent vascular filling or even the inability to perfuse fine capillaries (Leyssens et al., 2021, Qiu et al., 2016).
The hereby described approach with µAngiofil provides more complete vascular filling (Hlushchuk et al., 2020, Leyssens et al., 2021) and is suitable for the visualization of the microvasculature within bone tissue with or without decalcification (Fig. 2).
If a subsequent histological evaluation is desired, the developed decalcifying protocols enable correlative imaging of the same sample with preserved intravascular contrast agent (Schaad et al., 2017).

Distinct differences in the attenuation between the µAngiofil and bone tissue allow for assessing vascularization and bone growth without the need to make two scans (before and after decalcification) and register them, saving labor, scanning time and without damaging the sample composition.

The presented here microangioCT approach can be used for simultaneous visualization of the hard (and eventually soft) tissues and their vascularization in a variety of small and large animal models.
One of the noteworthy possible applications of this approach is simultaneous visualization of the bone microarchitecture and microvasculature of the bone metastases in the murine xenograft tumor model (Fig. 3).
Using such an approach, the response to specific treatments, including bone-targeted and antiangiogenic therapies, can be assessed within the same sample and in 3D, followed by histological examination if needed (Xu et al., 2022).
The gained results could provide further insights onto yet not completely elucidated interplay between angiogenesis and bone growth, bone lysis and bone turnover.
The results will be crucial for selecting potential drug candidates and proper treatment decision and efficacy prediction.
The decalcification step would be very disadvantageous for bone metastatic models, since pathological processes in the bone tissue should be thoroughly assessed because they may lead to so-called skeletal-related-events, which are associated with shortened survival and deterioration of quality of life (D\'Oronzo et al., 2019), and should therefore be avoided.

In dental research, preclinical models can be divided into small and large animals.
Besides more practical size, small animal models (e.g., mouse) are very popular in the research labs, including dental ones, and less expensive.
Moreover, there is a variety of genetically modified lines available which could facilitate imaging if using corresponding imaging modalities (Yi et al., 2019).
The microCT scan of correspondingly small samples perfused with µAngiofil can be performed with a voxel size around 1 µm, leading to an excellent detail resolution (Fig. 4).

Nonetheless, the small size of hemimandible samples and availability of the transgenic lines allow another recently published imaging approach in the murine models.
This recently described PEGASOS tissue-clearing-based approach could be a viable option for the visualization of the peri-implant tissues and vasculature in small animal models (Yi et al., 2019).
Among the most significant limitations of this tissue-clearing-based imaging approach are: i) differential shrinkage among soft and hard tissues, leading to anisotropic distortion in samples where both tissue types (plus eventual metal implant) are present; ii) limited depth (e.g., around 800 µm in a mouse model) due to the challenges of achieving complete transparency of bone tissue (Yi et al., 2019).
These limitations become even more critical in a big animal model with metal implants.
Large anisotropic distortion of the sample may lead to the alteration of the common site of interest, namely the implant-tissue interface.
Furthermore, the actual limitation of the depth makes such an approach completely impracticable.

The microangioCT approach does not have such limitations and can be easily applied for visualization of hemimandible and its vascularization in a large animal model like Göttingen minipig (Fig. 5).
µAngiofil has noticeably different attenuation than mineralized bone and it is useful when scanning the samples, which contain high-density materials, like metals.
It is thus possible to visualize and distinguish soft tissue, bone tissue, vessels filled with the contrast agent as well as metal implants according to their gray values in the histogram (Fig. 6).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating non-destructive 3D imaging of the microvasculature of bone in the proximity of metal objects/implants in a large animal model.

Limitations of the approach
---------------------------

The most significant limitation of the suggested approach is the general limitation of microCT imaging, namely, the correlation between the resolution and the sample size.
If the sample is small, i.e. only a few millimeters in diameter, the voxel size may be as small as 1 µm or less enabling visualization of the microvasculature down to the capillary bed (Hlushchuk et al., 2019, Hlushchuk et al., 2020, Hlushchuk et al., 2018, Schaad et al., 2017).
In case of large samples, like minipig hemimandible, the achievable voxel size is around 10 times larger (≥8 µm), and it is therefore, not possible to reach that level of resolution.
In such samples the finest microvessels with diameter under 40 µm cannot be accurately visualized (see Fig. 5 & 6).

Nonetheless, the presented approach is, according to our knowledge, the best what can be achieved with the modern microCT scanners and is a big step forward for qualitative and quantitative imaging in tissue engineering and implantology research as well as many other related research fields.
