## Discussion {.page_break_before}

Adequate vascularization is a prerequisite for successful bone formation and regeneration as well as osseointegration of biomaterials [@doi:10.1021/acsabm.1c00979; @doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2020.0132; @doi:10.1242/dev.136861; @doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1042/CS20180155].
Without high-resolution imaging, the interplay between vasculature and bone tissue cannot be adequately studied, making it impossible to control these processes.

Non-destructive microCT imaging is considered the only viable approach for 3D imaging of an intact bone-implant interface [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578].
To properly distinguish the vasculature from other soft tissue structures, instillation of a contrast agent or producing an intravascular casting is necessary.

Our hereby presented method of imaging the microvasculature within bones based on instillation with µAngiofil overcomes several drawbacks of previously described methods (see [Introduction] for a thorough explanation) and is suitable for the visualization of the microvasculature within bone tissue with or without decalcification (Fig. @fig:2).

The developed decalcifying protocols enable correlative imaging of the same sample with preserved intravascular contrast agent with subsequent classical histological evaluation [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].
Such a decalcification step enables tomographic imaging of the murine hind limb vasculature with less artifacts around the bone at lower acceleration voltages of the X-ray source due to the reduced radiopacity of the bone.
Such lower acceleration voltages often enable shortened scanning times, leading to a higher sample throughput.
Furthermore, decalcifying the sample enables a threshold-based segmentation of the vasculature and facilitates histological evaluation of the sample, as both described previously [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].

Due to the distinct differences in the X-ray attenuation of µAngiofil and the bone tissue we can also forgo the step of bone decalcification.
We thus avoid the need for repeated tomographic scans (before and after decalcification) and subsequent registration of the two scans and are still able to assess vascularization and bone growth directly in one scan.
This saves machine and labor time and does not damage the sample composition.
The microangioCT approach we present here can thus be used for simultaneous visualization of hard and soft tissues and their vascularization in small and large animal models.

One of the noteworthy possible applications of this approach is simultaneous visualization of the bone microarchitecture and microvasculature of bone metastases in a murine xenograft tumor model (Fig. @fig:3).
Especially for studying bone metastatic models it is crucial to find a method that allows for the correct assessment of the microvasculature without decalcifying the sample.
Such a decalcification would hinder the thorough assessment of pathological processes in bone tissue.
These pathological processes can lead to so-called skeletal-related-events, which are associated with shortened survival and deterioration of quality of life [@doi:10.1016/j.jbo.2018.10.004], and should therefore be avoided.
Our method allows to study the response to specific treatments, including bone-targeted and antiangiogenic therapies.
These can be assessed within the same sample and in 3D, and be followed up with a histological examination if desired [@doi:10.3390/cancers14143443].
The presented method could offer additional insights into the interplay between angiogenesis and bone growth, bone lysis, and bone turnover, which have not been fully elucidated yet.
The results will be crucial for selecting potential drug candidates and proper treatment decision and efficacy prediction.

In dental research, preclinical models can be divided into small and large animals.
Small animal models, particularly mice and rats, are highly popular, due to their practical size and cost-effectiveness.
The microCT scan of correspondingly small samples perfused with µAngiofil can be performed with a voxel size around 1 µm, providing excellent detail resolution (Fig. @fig:4).
Murine mandibles and teeth are challenging for assessing the vasculature.
This is due to the location of most of the vessels within the bone canals or in the proximity of the hard tissue.
This consequently leads to the lack of larger bone-free volumes in which the vasculature is easily distinguishable.
Gray value based segmentation of bone and contrast-agent-instilled vasculature is compounded by the fact that murine bone has a higher mineral bone density of both cortical and trabecular bone when compared to humans and minipigs [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004].
Nonetheless, with the improved perfusion protocol mentioned above we achieved appropriate imaging of such samples and were able to visualize differences between the X-ray absorption levels of µAngiofil and mineralized bone tissue well.

Nonetheless, the small size of hemimandible samples and availability of the transgenic lines would allow for a recently published imaging approach [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] in the murine models.
This tissue-clearing-based approach could be a viable option for the visualization of the peri-implant tissues and vasculature in small animal models.
There are limitations of such a tissue-clearing-based imaging approach, though.
Namely
  i) differential shrinkage among soft and hard tissues, leading to anisotropic distortion in samples where both tissue types (plus eventual metal implant) are present;
  ii) limited depth (around 800 µm in a mouse model [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578]) due to the challenges of achieving complete transparency of bone tissue.
Large anisotropic distortion of the sample may lead to the alteration of the common site of interest, namely the implant-tissue interface.
The limitation of the maximal achievable visible depth makes such an approach impracticable for usage in large animal models.

Our presented microangioCT approach does not have such limitations and can be easily applied for visualization of hemimandible and its vascularization in a large animal model like Göttingen minipig (Fig. @fig:5).
µAngiofil has noticeably different attenuation than mineralized bone and allows for distinct distinction, segmentation and visualization of soft tissue, bone tissue, vessels filled with the contrast agent as well as metal implants according to their gray values in the histogram (Fig. @fig:6).

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study demonstrating non-destructive 3D imaging of the microvasculature of bone in the proximity of metal objects/implants in a large animal model.

### Limitations of our approach

To achieve the excellent results shown in this study it is paramount that the contrast agent instillation is performed in a reproducible and controlled way.
It is thus important that a the instillation is performed by a skilled experimentator, with the help of a syringe pump.
Other contrast agents might be slightly easier to use for instillation, but fail to give equally high-quality results, as mentioned above.

Our presented method for the investigation of the microvasculature within the bone tissue is thus mainly limited by the imaging method.
Namely, this is the correlation between achievable resolution and the physical size of the imaged sample.
If the sample is only a few millimeters in diameter, the voxel sizes in the range of 1 µm enable visualization of the microvasculature down to the capillary bed [@doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1007/s00429-020-02158-8; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017; @doi:10.1038/srep41842].
In case of large samples, like minipig hemimandible, the achievable voxel size is approximately 10 times larger (≥8 µm).
In such samples the finest microvessels with diameter under 40 µm thus cannot be accurately visualized (see Fig. @fig:5 & @fig:6).

Apart from this general limitation of the tomographic imaging, the hereby presented approach of instilling the vasculature in the bone tissue with a polymerizing contrast agent is a big step forward for qualitative and quantitative imaging.
The presented method is suitable to answer important questions regarding the microvasculature in tissue engineering and implantology research as well as many other related research fields.
