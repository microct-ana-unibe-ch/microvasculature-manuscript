## Discussion {.page_break_before}

Adequate vascularization is a prerequisite for successful bone formation and regeneration as well as osseointegration of biomaterials [@doi:10.1021/acsabm.1c00979; @doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2020.0132; @doi:10.1242/dev.136861; @doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1042/CS20180155].
Without high-resolution imaging, the interplay between vasculature and bone tissue cannot be adequately studied, making it impossible to control these processes.

Non-destructive microCT imaging is widely regarded as the only viable method for 3D imaging of an intact bone-implant interface [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578].
To accurately differentiate vasculature from other soft tissue structures, the use of a contrast agent or the creation of a vascular replica is essential.

The imaging method we present, which involves instillation with μAngiofil, addresses several limitations of previously described techniques (see [Introduction]).
This approach enables the visualization of both bone tissue and the vasculature within it, with or without prior decalcification (see Fig. @fig:2).

The established decalcifying protocols enable correlative imaging of the same sample with preserved intravascular contrast agent with subsequent classical histological evaluation [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].
This decalcification step enables tomographic imaging of the murine hind limb vasculature with fewer artifacts around the bone at lower X-ray source acceleration voltages due to the reduced radiopacity of the sample.
Lower acceleration voltages often allow for shorter scanning times, leading to higher sample throughput.
Furthermore, decalcifying the sample enables a threshold-based segmentation of the vasculature, and facilitates histological evaluation of the sample, as previously described [@doi:10.1038/srep41842].
However, the decalcification step renders bone tissue transparent, preventing simultaneous 3D imaging of the bony and vascular structures.

In many models, due to the distinct differences in the X-ray attenuation of μAngiofil and the bone tissue, we can forgo the time-consuming decalcification step.
This allows us to directly assess vascularization and bone growth based on a single microCT scan (Fig. @fig:6). Although finding the optimal scanning parameters may require some expertise and machine time, the single scan approach should be aimed for. While being sufficiently effecient in most cases, in some situations the single scan approach does not always yield optimal results (e.g., Fig. @fig:4) and may lead to difficulties with segmentation and subsequent image analysis. Based on our experience, it is paramount to have as distinctive imaging of various components of the studied samples as possible to aid in further image analysis. In such cases, a dual-energy scanning technique may offer a more efficient solution (see Fig. @fig:7).
It is advisable to conduct two sequential different energy scans without removing the sample. In this way the dataset registration needed for dual-energy approach is simplified. Altogether, this allows to avoid the time-consuming decalcification step, and provides simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature while keeping the sample intact.

One of the noteworthy applications of the microangioCT approach is the simultaneous visualization of the bone microarchitecture and microvasculature of bone metastases in a murine xenograft tumor model (Fig. @fig:3).
Especially for studying bone metastatic models, it is crucial to find a method that allows for the correct assessment of the microvasculature without decalcifying the sample.
Decalcification would hinder the thorough assessment of pathological processes in bone tissue.
These pathological processes can cause skeletal-related events, which are associated with shortened survival and deterioration of quality of life [@doi:10.1016/j.jbo.2018.10.004], and should therefore be avoided.
Our method allows studying the response to specific treatments, including bone-targeted and antiangiogenic therapies.
These can be assessed in 3D within the same sample and followed up with a histological examination if desired [@doi:10.3390/cancers14143443].
The presented method could offer additional insights into the interplay between angiogenesis, bone growth, bone lysis, and bone turnover, which have not been fully elucidated yet.
The potential findings can be crucial for selecting potential drug candidates, making proper treatment decisions, and efficacy prediction.

In dental research, preclinical models can be divided into small and large animals.
Small animal models, particularly mice and rats, are highly popular, due to their practical size and cost-effectiveness.
The microCT scan of correspondingly small samples, perfused with μAngiofil can be performed with a voxel size of around 1 μm, providing excellent detail resolution (see Fig. @fig:4).
Murine mandibles and teeth are challenging for assessing the vasculature.
This is due to the location of most of the vessels within the bone canals or in the proximity of the hard tissue.
This leads to a lack of larger bone-free volumes where the vasculature is easily distinguishable.
Gray value-based segmentation of bone and contrast-agent-instilled vasculature is compounded by the fact that murine bone has a higher mineral bone density when compared to other species [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004; @doi:10.1292/jvms.66.599].
Nonetheless, with the dual-energy approach described above, we achieved appropriate imaging of such samples and were able to visualize and distinguish vasculature within and from mineralized bone tissue.

Further work, also from our group, and ongoing research is focusing on improving the segmentation of vasculature in microtomographic datasets.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for vascular segmentation [@doi:10.2144/btn-2020-0108].
Specifically, the U-Net architecture of CNNs seems very promising for vascular segmentation tasks and has been applied for the segmentation of murine vascular networks [@doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.320672] and to high-resolution (~20 µm voxel size) tomographic datasets of intact human organs [@doi:10.1038/s41598-024-77582-5].
While neural network-based segmentation methods have shown promising results, the scarcity of annotated public datasets poses a challenge for training robust models and developing models that can generalize across different tissues, modalities, scales, and pathologies remains an active area of investigation.

In the small animal model studies without metal or similar biomedical implants, the application of whole mouse clearing and imaging with vDISCO approach could be the method of choice [@doi:10.1038/s41596-022-00788-2].
Another promising improvement to the clearing protocols and immunolabeling of the samples with the bone tissue is the introduction of the collagenase digestion step, which improves the antibody penetration throughout the stained bones and, therefore, the immunostaining [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.031].
Although newer tissue clearing and immunostaining immersion-based visualization techniques provide high-resolution, three-dimensional images of intact samples, these methods may produce artifacts such as tissue deformation and illumination inhomogeneity [@doi:10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100151].

The presence of implanted biomedical devices further complicates the imaging process.
For murine model studies, a recently published tissue-clearing-based imaging approach [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] could be a viable option for the visualization of the peri-implant tissues and vasculature due to the small size of hemimandible samples and the availability of transgenic mouse lines.
However, there are limitations to such a tissue-clearing imaging approach.
Namely:
  i) differential shrinkage among soft and hard tissues, leading to anisotropic distortion in samples where both tissue types (plus eventual metal implant) are present;
  ii) limited imaging depth (approximately 800 μm in a mouse model [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578]) due to the challenges of achieving complete transparency of bone tissue.
Significant anisotropic distortion in the sample may alter the implant-tissue interface, a common site of interest.
The limitation of the maximal achievable imaging depth makes such an approach impractical for usage in large animal models.

Our presented microangioCT approach does not have such limitations and can be easily applied for visualization of hemimandible and its vascularization in a large animal model like Göttingen minipig (Fig. @fig:5).
Iodine-based μAngiofil exhibits significantly different attenuation properties than mineralized bone in most species and allows for the distinction, segmentation, and visualization of soft tissue, bone tissue, vessels filled with the contrast agent, and metal implants according to their gray values in the histogram (see Fig. @fig:6).

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate non-destructive 3D imaging of the microvasculature of bone in the proximity of metal objects/implants in a large animal model.

While this study primarily focused on qualitative visualization of vascular structures, we acknowledge the importance of quantitative analyses.
Future work will incorporate metrics such as vessel diameter, connectivity, and perfusion efficiency to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of µAngiofil's performance.

### Limitations of our approach

Achieving the excellent results demonstrated in this study requires reproducible and controlled instillation of the contrast agent.
To ensure this, the procedure should be performed by skilled personnel using a syringe pump.

The method we presented for investigating the microvasculature within bone tissue is primarily limited by the imaging technique.
Specifically, this limitation arises from the correlation between achievable resolution and the physical size of the imaged sample.
For small samples, such as those just a few millimeters in diameter, voxel sizes on the order of 1 μm enable visualization of the microvasculature down to the capillary bed [@doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1007/s00429-020-02158-8; @doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017; @doi:10.1038/srep41842].
However, for larger samples, such as the minipig hemimandible, the achievable voxel size is approximately 10 times larger (≥8 μm).
In such cases, the finest microvessels with diameters under 40 μm cannot be accurately visualized (see Fig. @fig:5 & @fig:6).

Beyond the inherent limitations of tomographic imaging, the approach presented here—instilling the vasculature in bone tissue with a polymerizing contrast agent—represents a significant advancement in biomedical X-ray imaging.
This innovative method holds great promise for addressing key questions in tissue engineering, implantology, and a wide range of related research fields.
