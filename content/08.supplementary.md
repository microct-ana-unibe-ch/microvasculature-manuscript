### Log files of all the tomographic scans performed for this study

The table show in [SampleAndScanData.csv](https://github.com/microct-ana-unibe-ch/microvasculature-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/SampleAndScanData.csv) gives a tabular overview on the samples studied and the relevant parameters of the tomographic imaging.
This file was generated with a [data processing notebook](https://github.com/habi/BrukerSkyScanLogfileRuminator/tree/microvasculature-manuscript) and contains information read from *all* the log files of *all* the scans we performed.
A copy of each log file is also available [online](https://github.com/microct-ana-unibe-ch/microvasculature-manuscript/tree/main/content/data).
These log files include *all* the data necessary to exactly replicate the image acquisition.
