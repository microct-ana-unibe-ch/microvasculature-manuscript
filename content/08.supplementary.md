### Log files of all the tomographic scans performed for this study

The table shown in [SampleAndScanData.csv](https://github.com/microct-ana-unibe-ch/microvasculature-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/SampleAndScanData.csv) gives a tabular overview on the samples studied and the relevant parameters of the tomographic imaging.
The table was generated with an adapted version of our [data processing notebook](https://github.com/habi/BrukerSkyScanLogfileRuminator/tree/microvasculature-manuscript) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.15607944] and contains information read from *all* the log files of *all* the scans we performed.
The relevant text for each figure in the [Materials, Methods, and Results] was also produced by this notebook.
All raw log files are also available [online](https://github.com/microct-ana-unibe-ch/microvasculature-manuscript/tree/main/content/data).
These log files include *all* the data necessary to exactly replicate the image acquisition.
