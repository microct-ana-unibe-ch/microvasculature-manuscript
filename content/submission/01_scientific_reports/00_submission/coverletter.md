Dear Editorial Board,

We submit our manuscript titled *MicroCT-based imaging of microvasculature within bone and peri-implant tissues* for consideration as an original contribution to Scientific Reports.
David Haberthür and Oleksiy-Zakhar Khoma equally contributed to this work.

Our study introduces contrast agent-enhanced X-ray microtomographic imaging to visualize vasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models.
We document simultaneous imaging of microvascular and bone structures in murine tibia, a murine bone metastatic model, pulp chamber, gingiva, and periodontal ligaments.
Additionally, in a large animal model (minipig), we visualize and segment different tissue types and vessels in the hemimandible containing metal implants, making use of dual-energy scans to visualize relevant structures.

This study provides the first non-destructive 3D imaging of vasculature in both soft and hard tissues near metal implants in a large animal model.
Our approach represents a significant advancement in qualitative and quantitative imaging for tissue engineering, implantology, and related fields.

A preprint of the manuscript has been deposited on bioRχiv.

We look forward to your feedback.

Sincerely,
Ruslan Hluschuk
