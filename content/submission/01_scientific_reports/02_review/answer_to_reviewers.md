# Reviewer Comments:

## Reviewer 1
> The manuscript entitled ” MicroCT-based imaging of microvasculature within the bone tissue” by David Haberthür et al. submitted to Scientific Reports as an original article presents one contrasting methods for visualization of vessels in bone using microCT. 

> The manuscript is well written, showing beautiful images but lacks a proper analysis. It is more of a general presentation of various scanned samples, ranging from small to large, only showing the feasibility visually while not evaluating properly the integrity of the vascular network (hence the filling capacity), not properly assessing the contrast variations, not really proposing the best practice for particular samples (could be useful for the reader). Each sample is scanned differently, from rather short 1h to very long scans >24 h, based on the number of acquired images (frame averaging, rotation steps and rotation limit, exposure time). How were these chosen, and could these be optimized to get enough contrast/resolution to do properly analyses while reducing the scan time? Furthermore, a large number of different scanners have been used, Skyscan 1172, 1272, 1273, 2214 without discussing the pros and cons among them. I guess most samples could be imaged by one of the scanners.

> My suggestion is to make it into a proper methods paper instead where more analyses and comparisons are done and critically discuss pros and cons. Yes, one main limitation using microCT is sample size vs resolution, however depending on scientific questions samples could always be reduced in size. For example, the implants, this sample could easily be reduced to only include one implant, enabling higher resolution and assessment of the vasculature in the close vicinity to the implant surface. For this sample, a segmentation was done, while not describing how. Another limitation here when having metal implants (clearly visible in Fig 6B) is the increase in contrast within the threads of an implant, how to circumvent this when segmenting? 

> The division into a combined materials, methods and results section is rather confusing, please make a proper methods section. Use tables to summaries the setting for each sample, also including the sample size. Also include the camera and eventual binning during scanning as some of the scanners may have different cameras.

> There are 14 authors on the paper which is excessive for the yet limited amount of data presented, however ok if the papers is made in to a comprehensive methods papers.

## Reviewer 2
> The manuscript titled "MicroCT-based Imaging of Microvasculature within Bone and Peri-implant Tissues" demonstrates significant potential as an innovative tool for bioimaging in dentistry. However, there are several areas that would benefit from further clarification.

> In the Materials and Methods section, it would be helpful for the authors to specify the gender and age of the control mice and minipigs used in the study, as this information is crucial for interpreting the results.

> The authors present various cases involving the injection of μAngiofil to illustrate different imaging methods with and without decalcification. However, the manuscript would be strengthened by providing details about the total volume of the contrast agent applied, the timeframe between its application and the subsequent microCT imaging, and how these factors might influence the results.

> Additionally, the discussion could be enhanced by addressing potential artifacts related to the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of the contrast agent, as these may affect imaging quality and flow.

> A comparison between dual-energy CT and imaging with decalcification of the same sample, particularly regarding attenuation and 3D imaging, would offer valuable insights and further support the findings.

> Moreover, details on how tissue segmentation was performed are currently lacking. Clarifying whether there were differences in segmentation across the various cases examined would add depth to the methodology.

> Finally, while the research has important implications for peri-implant studies, discussing its relevance in cases involving guided bone regeneration would be beneficial. Considering the additional variables introduced by different biomaterials and their impact on density could enrich the manuscript and outline future research directions.

> Addressing these points would enhance the clarity and scientific rigor of the manuscript, underscoring its contributions to the field.
