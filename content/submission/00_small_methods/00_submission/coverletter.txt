Dear Editorial Board

Herewith we submit our manuscript on *MicroCT-based imaging of microvasculature within the bone tissue* as an original contribution to Small Methods.
David Haberthür and Oleksiy-Zakhar Khoma equally contributed to the work.

The manuscript introduces contrast agent enhanced X-ray microtomographic imaging and visualization of vasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models.
This study documents simultaneous microvascular and bone imaging in murine tibia, murine bone metastatic model, pulp chamber, gingiva and periodontal ligaments.
In a large animal model (minipig) we present the visualization and segmentation of different tissue types and vessels in the hemimandible containing several metal implants.

Herewith we provide for the first time a non-destructive 3D-imaging approach of the vasculature within soft and hard tissues in the vicinity of metal implants in a large animal model.
The presented approach is, according to our knowledge, the best what can be achieved with the modern microCT-scanners and is a big step forward for qualitative and quantitative imaging in the tissue engineering and implantology research as well as many other related research fields.

A preprint of the manuscript has been deposited to biorRχiv.

We are looking forward to your positive, feedback.
