Dear Editorial Board,

We submit our manuscript titled *MicroCT-based imaging of microvasculature within bone and peri-implant tissues* for consideration as an original contribution to Tomography of Materials and Structures.
David Haberthür and Oleksiy-Zakhar Khoma equally contributed to this work.

Our study introduces contrast agent-enhanced X-ray microtomographic imaging to visualize vasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models.
We show that this approach can be used in multiple animal models and the datasets may be acquired using various microtomography systems.
We document simultaneous imaging of microvascular and bone structures in murine tibia, a murine bone metastatic model, pulp chamber, gingiva, and periodontal ligaments.
Additionally, in a large animal model (minipig), we visualize and segment different tissue types and vessels in the hemimandible containing metal implants, making use of dual-energy scans to visualize relevant structures.

This study provides the first non-destructive 3D imaging of vasculature in both soft and hard tissues near metal implants in a large animal model.
Our approach represents a significant advancement in qualitative and quantitative imaging for tissue engineering, implantology, guided bone regeneration and related fields.

A preprint of the manuscript has been deposited on bioRχiv at https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.08.531678 and has already been cited by others.

We look forward to your feedback.

Sincerely,
Ruslan Hlushchuk
