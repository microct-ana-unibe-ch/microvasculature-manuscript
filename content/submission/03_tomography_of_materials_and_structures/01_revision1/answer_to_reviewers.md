# Reviewer 1

> The study proposes a contrast agent - the µAngiofil - that promises to fill even microvessels; its performance was verified by the authors ex-vivo on different animal models: i.e nr. 1 21-month-old transgenic VEGF male mouse, five CB17SCID male mice, three C57BL/6 mice, and two Göttingen minipigs.
> Different microtomographic systems, with several experimental settings were tested in order to allow the analysis of biopsies of interest in the field of dentistry and oral pathology.
> The contrast agent is already on the market and, according to what the authors claim, it holds great promise for addressing key questions in tissue engineering, implantology, and a wide range of related research fields.
> Although this reviewer agrees with the authors that the proposed contrast agent could be interesting as an aid in the diagnosis of various pathologies and also in the field of tissue engineering, at the same time doubts arise as to how the experimental activity was conducted and whether it can demonstrate what the authors claim above.

We thank the reviewer for the agreement on the usefulnes of applying µAngiofil to the study of vasculature in various fields of research.
Below, we address the concerns raised regarding the experimental methodology and its ability to support our claims:

## Main Comments:

> Therefore, the first doubt lies in the novelty of the study.
> In fact, there are already several studies in the literature that use microAngiofill also for the study of bone tissue.
> For this reason, it would be appropriate to better outline how this study surpasses the performance of previous ones, paying particular attention to citing all these studies.

> Moreover, the authors have omitted to cite, neither in the Introduction nor in the Discussion, research and review studies that have already addressed the problem of simultaneously visualizing and, above all, quantifying vascular flow and bone microarchitecture; in particular, the studies performed at the synchrotron using phase contrast microtomography without the use of contrast media, successfully performed on both animal and human model biopsies (examples: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00769 ; https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2012-0136 , etc. ).

Interestingly, both Alessandra Giuliani and Max Langer are the overlapping authors in the Venn diagram of all the authors of these two example publications.
One of the authors of the manuscript reviewed was employed as a PostDoc at a synchrotron beamline, and we are familiar with the research conducted in such facilities.

A major limitation of both referenced studies is the restricted accessibility of their methodology, namely 'synchrotron phase tomography' and 'synchrotron radiation-based holotomography'.
The technique presented in our manuscript is much more attainable for researchers in the preclinical field compared to securing beamtime at a synchrotron facility.

Furthermore, both referenced studies rely on phase-contrast imaging, which provides enhanced spectral sensitivity.
However, such imaging techniques are not commonly available in commercially accessible desktop micro-CT systems.
In contrast, our approach offers a more practical and feasible alternative for researchers without the need for specialized synchrotron infrastructure.

Having said all that we decided to mention the possibility to perform studies of the vasculature in bone with synchrotron radiation microtomography in the introduction of our manuscript, actually strenthening our case for applicability of our presented method in broad preclinical reasearch.
We only cited the first of the mentioned studies, since the second one highlights a severe drawback of synchrotron radiation studies (very small visualized sample volume (in that case ~1.25 mm³), which is many times smaller than the volume of the implants shown in our figure 6).

> In any case this reviewer continues to consider the proposed problem relating to the simultaneous visualization of soft tissues (in this specific case, the vascular endothelium) and hard tissues (bones, teeth, dental implants, etc.) through the use of the benchtop microCT.

We are *not* visualizing (and interested in) the vascular endothelium, this is beyond the scope and the detail resolution of the present manuscript.

> Unfortunately, this reviewer fears that the problem has not been well focused in the present study and, consequently, the experimental method to address that.
> In fact, both in dental diagnostics and in oral pathology, up to bone tissue engineering, the object of study requires a very high resolution to be able to visualize even the smallest blood capillaries which are the main actors in tumor kinetics and tissue regeneration.

We acknowledge that resolving the smallest blood capillaries requires very high resolution tomographic imaging and have previously showen that this is possible in https://doi.org/10.1038/srep41842, where we imaged the contrast-enhanced vasculature network in murine hind-limbs with sub-micrometer voxel side lenghts (0.66 μm).
However, our study was not designed to resolve individual capillaries but rather to assess the overall effectiveness of the contrast medium in enhancing vascular visualization within a practical and widely accessible imaging framework.

> Consequently, to appreciate the effectiveness of this contrast medium, it is first necessary to have a high-resolution tomograph (I would say a nanotomograph!) to maintain a single experimental setting for all the tests.

One of the machines that was used for imaging in our study is the SkyScan 2214, offering a 3D spatial resolution <500 nm.
We have performed scans with voxel sizes 0.66 μm on our machine, but the limits on the visible field of view (~1 mm³) are so constrained that the sample volume that is imaged for such scans is *not* large enough to give insights into biologically relevant processes.
It would for example not be possible to image the vascular network *around* an implant in the hemimandibles (as shown in our figures 5-7) without destroying the sample, as features of interest are much larger than the available field of view at this very high resolution.

> Subsequently, it is necessary to provide an adequate number of biopsies (same situ in animal models of the same strain, age, sex, etc) that present the same clinical problem, in order to proceed with a quantitative analysis compared to a control group (also made of adequate number of elements).
> In fact, only a quantitative analysis, based on selection of appropriate shape complexity features, can establish the actual efficacy of a contrast agent in these contexts. The visualization of large vessels as performed in your work does not determine the effectiveness of contrast agents in solving problems that are more specifically related to micro vessels, to capillaries, for example in the case of tumor invasion.

Regarding the experimental methodology, we recognize the importance of standardization in animal models, including sample size, strain, age, and sex.
While our study was primarily intended to give an overview of the possibilities of the method, future investigations will incorporate a larger and more standardized sample set to allow for robust quantitative analyses.
Additionally, we agree that a quantitative evaluation using shape complexity features could provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of the contrast agent.
While our current study focused on qualitative assessments, we acknowledge the value of a more refined morphometric approach in future research.

Finally, while we primarily visualized "large" vascular structures, this does not preclude the application of our contrast medium in assessing microvasculature.
Within the actual resolution constraints of microCT as well as synchrotron-radiation based microtomography combined with the total visualized sample size (dental implant in a large animal model with intact peri-implant tissues) it seems non-realistic to obtain enough detail resolution to assess single capillaries.

We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive feedback and will incorporate these considerations into our ongoing research to further refine and validate the applicability of our method.

## Minor comments:

> In the Materials and Methods chapter, it would be necessary to insert a descriptive table of each animal model studied, reporting strain, age, number, sex, model of the tomograph used to study it, pixel size, Energy, current, etc.

Information on the animals used and and overview on the settings of the tomographic imaging were already present in the manuscript text.
The complete information on the tomographic imaging was already present in a table in the supplementary materials.
We included all the requested information into the mentioned table.

The relevant parameters of the tomographic imaging are mentioned in the text at the beginning of each relevant section.
In addition, a tabular collection of the relevant parameters is collated in a table both attached as supplementary material and available online (linked in the manuscript) at https://github.com/habi/BrukerSkyScanLogfileRuminator/tree/microvasculature-manuscript
In addition---as mentioned in the supplementary materials section---*all* logfiles of *all* scans performed for this study are also available online, permitting the keen reader to exactly replicate the tomographic scan settings we used.

> avoid repeating the same concepts in different parts of the manuscript; for example, the fact that decalcification does not allow the simultaneous study of bone and vessels.

> if the object of the study lies in the characteristics of the contrast agent, it is not enough to recall some literature to describe it, but a brief description of its preparation is also needed.

We added a paragraph on the preparation of the contrast agent at the beginning of the method section.
The instillation of the contrast agent was explained in detail for the first experiment.
We generalized the description of the instillation for all experiments and added this description after this general paragraph.

> Nowadays, threshold-based segmentation of tomographic images is obsolete for many researches since convolutional neural networks support more performant segmentations, also based on morphology and orientation of structures.
> Although this is not the subject of this study, it is necessary to mention these options in the Discussion, citing the supporting literature.

The reviewer is absolutely correct that convolutional neural networks are a powerful tool for vascular segmentation.
We have already peformed some work on the segmentation of the vasculature with neural network-based approaches for the project dealing with implants in the minipig mandibles, but the results are not ready to be described in a manuscript.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to mention such approaches in our manuscript and added a paragraph in the discussion.

> With reference to the analyses conducted in Dual Energy, it is not very clear what the gain is in terms of vessels detection.
> The analysis carried out at 50kV already allows for a sufficiently clear threshold segmentation.
> In fact, the increase in energy (90kV) seems only allow for an increase in the counts, probably improving the peak shape referred to the vessels.

We agree that a gray value threshold-based segmentation seems already possible with the data from the 50 kV scan, but the compounding issue is that the mineralization of the mouse bones (and thus the gray value in the data) varies in a larger extent than what is visible in panel A of Fig. 7.
Combining both scans into a dual-energy dataset greatly enhances detectability.
As we state in the manuscript already, the difference in gray values for the bones from 50 kV to 90 kV positive, while the gray value difference inside the blood vessels between those values is negative, as is technically evident in panel C' of Fig. 7.
Your statement about already allowing threshold segmentation on the shown data is true in the case for the shown slice, but it is *not* true for the full three-dimensional dataset.

We hope that all these additions and clarifications address the reviewer's concerns, demonstrate the robustness of our methodology and the novelty of our findings.
We remain open to further suggestions to improve the manuscript.

# Reviewer 2

> The manuscript presents valuable results beautiful images of vasculature in different bones (in some cases including implants) imaged using µCT following perfusion with the contrast agent µAngiofil.

We thank the reviewer for their positive feedback on the quality of the results and the images presented in the manuscript.
We also appreciate the constructive suggestion to improve the structure of the manuscript to better highlight the main findings.

> While I believe that the results are methodology shown are very valuable, I do think that the manuscript could benefit from some restructuring to better highlight the main results.

We agree that the manuscript could benefit from a clearer presentation of the main results.
Based on the comments of *both* reviewers, we revised  the manuscript to ensure that the key findings are more prominently featured and removed redundancies in the text.

> At the current stage, the paper unfortunately reads more like a report than a publication and I think with the quality of the results that the authors have, they can provide more insights.

To ensure the manuscript reads less like a report and more like a cohesive publication, we streamlined the descriptions of experimental setups and imaging parameters, moving the full technical information to the table alredy present in the supplementary materials.

## Major comments:

> It's not clear to me why in this instance, the results should be merged with the materials and methods section.
> The details on µCT settings are not the main finding of this paper are they?
> Therefore, I would strongly suggest to separate the results, so that the authors can fully focus on presenting these in a separate section and/or merge them with the discussion section.

We agree that the choice to merge materials and methods might seem unusual for a manuscript.
Due to the focus on the methodology it seems to us that thes merge is warranted in the case of the present manuscript.
We would like to kindly refuse this suggestion, also in the light that it would not change the message of the manuscript.

> The images are very nice, but there is a number of very large figures (Figs. 1-5), not all of which appear necessary to me.
> At the same time the results are then not presented in much detail.
> Importantly, I'm missing any quantitative evaluation of the perfusion quality achieved.

Qualitative evaluation of the perfusion is done during instillation, due to the blue color of the contrast agent.
A secondary qualitative evaluation of the perfusion is performed after tomographic imaging and visualization, where continuitiy in the filling of the vasculature is visually evaluated.
In total, we have a failure rate of 5-20% of the instillations, where most failures actually happen at instillation, due to operator error.
Once the vasculature is filled with the contrast agent, nearly no discontinuities are observed, even for less skilled researchers instilling the contrast agent.
A quantitative evaluation of the achieved perfusion quality can to the best of our knowledge only be achieved with the analysis of the graph of the vasculature, showing no discontinuities.

> Segmentations are sometimes provided, e.g. in Fig.6, but it is unclear to me what we learn from this.
> This poses the important question: how do the authors assess the quality of their perfusion?
> I strongly believe that at least some quantification of vessel diameters, connectivity or similar should be performed for all instances.

As answered above, we qualitatively assess the perfusion during instillation and after scanning.
Ongoing research in our group focuses on the actual analysis of the vascular network, the presented work is focusing on the method of visualizing the vasculature under in a brad range of scenarios.

> As said above, the images provided are beautiful.
> But I am lacking in most cases a cross-sectional slice that would allow the reader to see the perfusion of the blood vessels more clearly.
> Importantly, I would also like to see corresponding histological slices that show whether certain blood vessels remained non-perfused and that would also show if any shrinkage of the perfusion agent occured.

So called correlative imaging was previously performed to validate the perfusion: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep41842, which is cited several times in the  present manuscript.
In that manuscript we have evaluated the perfusion efficiency of microAngiofil by correlating microCT slices with registered histological slices.
In a total of 3800 assessed capillaries we found that 98% of them were microAngiofil-filled, concluding that microAngiofil allows for an adequate perfusion and visualization of the entire vasculature including the smallest capillaries.
For some of the samples shown in the present study, namely those with metal implants it is also not feasible to produce histological slices.

> At this stage, I think these major comments should first be addressed before more minor comments would be commented on.

We hope that we were able address the major comments of this reviewer and look forward to any additional suggestions they may have.
