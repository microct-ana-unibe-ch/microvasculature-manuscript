Dear Anja Wecker, dear Reviewer#1

We thank you for the opportunity to resubmit a revised version of our manuscript on *MicroCT-based imaging of microvasculature within the bone tissue* (Research Article, No. smtd.202300311).
Below you will find our point-by-point response to the issues mentioned by the anonymous reviever#1.

> We would expect that any requested additional data and results are obtained before resubmission.

As we state in one of the point-by-point responses to the reviewer below, additional data *does* exist, but since the focus of the manuscript is on the methodological side this additional data is not shown.
As the additional data and results are part of several follow-up studies which are currently being worked on, we are happy to share them *solely* for review purposes, but kindly refrain from adding them to this manuscript.
The anonymous reviewer asked us to add "a histological element", which we refuse to add, since this has been done multiple times before.

# Comments to authors

> The topic is of great interest to the field as being able to quantify bone and vasculature in a single uCT scan would be a great leap forward in our methodology.
> However, due to the low animal numbers it is difficult for me to call these true studies.
> It is more pilot data, or even more accurately, feasibility data.

We thank you for the kind comments regarding our methodology.
We are well aware of the issue with low animal numbers.
We deliberately present an overview of our instillation and analysis method to give an overview.
Proper segmenation and analysis *is* possible, as we show in Fig. 6.
We *did* perform quantification in another study (linked in the text, shortly before Fig. 1), but focus on the *imaging* part in the present manuscript.

> Further, the methods are not well described, and the outcomes assessed do not adequately support the author's assertions that quantification from a single scan is possible.

We have improved the description of the presented method in each section.
The assertion that a quantification from a single scan *is* possible, as we show in Fig. 6.
Further work (currently being written) will focus on the quantification of the vessels around implants in the hemimandibles.

> Also, the text seems rather disjointed and unnecessarily repetitive.

Upon thorough inspection of the text we can confirm the meandering 'storytelling'.
Most of the text has been reworked thoroughly for minimizing repetitions.

## Major Comments:
> Introduction - p. 1 lines 37 to 44 and lines 48 to p. 2 line 3.
> My understanding is that, with the exception of the Nunez 2017 paper, these are all essentially the same methodologies (i.e. fill the vascular network with something) with the same problems (i.e. poor infilling and adequate contrast for within soft tissue but not for within bone).
> The Nunez paper discusses a next generation use of xray imaging, propagation-based phase contrast-enhanced tomography, without any addition of anything to the vascular network.
> I think that is a whole other thing which doesn't need to be mentioned in the introduction.
> If the authors want to bring it up in the discussion, that sounds great, but it's distracting here.
> I think the content of these two paragraphs should be combined and edited to be more concise about what is currently in use and what the common problems are.
> What does an ideal product/formulation look like?

> Introduction - p. 2 - lines 4 to 5 - I know why metal implants - especially large ones - are an issue with microCT scanning (i.e. beam hardening and imaging artifacts), but as written I don't think the average reader will.
> Please add a sentence or two explaining what these issues are and why they occur.

We [expanded the paragraph](https://github.com/microct-ana-unibe-ch/microvasculature-manuscript/commit/7905d2aa6be18baec3de21df78027bb2528e8f02) with a description of which artefacts can occur and how.

> Introduction - p. 2 line 9 to 11 - I am not an expert at other imaging modalities, but I find it hard to believe that microCT is the *only* approach for imaging implants in bone.
> Please add an explanation for this assertion or better frame it's relative importance to other options like MRI (e.g. "MicroCT is the best…. Because….").

As you state correctly, micrCT imaging is not the *only* approach to image implants in bones.
But it is the only approach to do it *non-desctructively*, in three dimensions and at the desired resolution, as we state in the text and is stated in the linked reference [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578].
As you also state correctly MRI imaging can be used to visualize implants in bones, but does not offer the resolution needed to assess micro-vasculature in proximity of the implants.
As far as we know, magnetic resonance imaing does *not* offer a voxel resolution below 100 μm, which is rather easily obtained with microCT imaging.

> Introduction & Methods/Results - There is a lot of text in the Methods/Results that seems like it would be better suited in the Introduction.
> I think there should be some rationale about why teeth/jaw is being assessed beyond the common use of metal implants.

Thank you for this suggestion, we have sentence explaining our rationale.

> Introduction - throughout - The authors vaguely allude throughout the introduction (and discussion) that there are issues or technical limitations with currently available options. However, they are only occasionally stated concretely. I would appreciate a little more discussion about the specific issues and how this new product is supposed to address them.

> Methods/Results - Animals - There is a blanket statement here that all procedures were approved by some sort of oversight board.
> Then there is more detailed information in the murine bone metastatic disease model and the large animal mandible model but not in the general mouse section nor the murine mandible section.
> Please make these parallel and include all information for all sections.
> This can be done with a combined statement in the Animal paragraph or within each section.
> My preference would be the former.
> Further, it is not clear to me which mice go to which study.
> Obviously the CB17SCID go with the tumor model, but which were used for the mandible and general?

We combined all animal experiment approvals into [a single paragraph](https://microct.ch/microvasculature-manuscript/#animals).
We also specified which animals were used in which part of the study.

> Methods/Results - All MicroCT References and Figure Legends - Information about the scanning parameters should appear in the methods text not the figure legends.

We updated the manuscript text with brief mentions of the most relevant scanning parameters.
A table with an extract of all the log files of all the shown scans was added in the [supplementary material section](https://microct.ch/microvasculature-manuscript/#supplementary-materials) of the manuscript.

> Methods/Results - Several sections - please provide information about how long after perfusion the limbs/jaws were harvested, how long were they fixed and at what temperature, what were they stored in for how long at what temperature, how long did decalcification last at what temperature.

We update all the paragraphs with information on fixation, storage and decalcification of the samples.

> Methods/Results - p. 3 - lines 38 to 43 - Please remove. There is nothing here that shows separate segmentation nor protection against osteoporosis.
> All that is shown is a beautiful image demonstrating what looks to be good infilling in a single animal.

We rephrased the paragraph according to the suggestion.
The detail about osteoporosis comes from the linked publication from our co-authors and has now been removed completely from our manuscript.

> Methods/Results - p. 4 - lines 47 to 57 - please remove and/or provide more data.
> I don't see any information about scan times.
> Again, there's no comparisons made to support much of the other text.
> That or it is already well known (e.g. decalcification removes the radiopacity of bone).
> There is no segmentation to support that it is easier.

The scanning times were not given in the manuscript, we excuse ourselves from this oversight.
For the scans shown in Fig. 2, the scanning times are - as a matter of fact - not different.
We deliberately performed both scans with the same setting (as can now be verified from the log files in the supplementary materials), to make them fully comparable.
The statement about the reduced scanning times due to decalcification was moved to the discussion section and explained there in a bit more depth.

> Methods/Results - p. 5 line 55 to p. 6 line 5 - I think this belongs in the introduction.

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
The paragraph was put in the materials and methods section to better link the two models mentioned above and below it together.
Nonetheless the paragraph has been moved to the introduction section of our manuscript.

> Methods/Results - p. 6 line 9 - What cancer type does this replicate?

As the two references linked at the end of the first sentence of this paragr state in their title, this is a prostate cancer model.

> Methods/Results - p. 7 lines 20 to 23 - Please remove and/or provide more data.
> Nothing in Figure 4 demonstrates a difference in radiopacity between the contrast agent and mineralized tissue. It does look like excellent infilling was achieved, but that's about it.

It appears that murine bone has a higher mineral bone density of both cortical and trabecular bone, compared to humans and cows, as well as minipigs [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.10.004].
Typical mice cortical bone density, which is comparable to bone density of mice teeth, ranges from ~900 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> in young mice  to ~1300 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> in adults [@doi:10.1172/JCI6730].
On the other hand, bone mineral density of minpigs goes from ~600 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> in young individuals up to a maximum of ~1100 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> [@doi:10.1292/jvms.66.599].
This makes it indeed more problematic to distinguish vasulature from the bone in mice simply based on the grey value and requires somewhat more advanced techniques and/or modified contrast formulation.
We removed this paragraph from the methods/results section, improved and moved it to the discussion section.

> Methods/Results - p 11 all, p. 12 Figure 6 - This is literally the only place where any data is given that suggestions individual segmentation is possible.
> However, since it is for an n of 1 (or maybe 2), it is hard to determine if this is a true result or a fluke.

In our manuscript we only show N=1, but this N=1 is a representative sample from a larger study of ours.
We could show more samples in the present manuscript, but deliberately chose not to do so.
The follow-up study is focusing solely on the peri-implant vascularization of bone and soft tissue.
We agree that the focus of our present study is more on the methodological side, hence we also submitted to 'Small Methods' and this comment led us to adapt the title of the manuscript emphasizing the methodological focus.

> Methods/Results - In general, more animals need to be added to the general murine and murine mandible.
> I would expect at least 3 if not 5 per group.
> I can understand the limitations of working with larger species - especially with implants - to procure additional samples quickly.
> Also, some sort of actual segmentation needs to be done with an objective outcome (i.e. numbers) to demonstrate true separation.
> Same for pre- and post-decalcification.
> I encourage the authors to better replicate their previous work by adding a histological element to confirm their findings.

As answered to the comment above, we actually imaged more samples for most of the requested groups.
If the editor and reviewer insist, we are happy to provide the data *for review purposes only*.
The additional images are deliberately *not* present in the present manuscript since they are out of scope here, and they are part of follow-up studies.
Fig. 6 shows that we can reach "true segmentation", as the visualization in panel D is solely based on the automatically extracted gray level regions shown in panel C, shown/explained in panel B.
We kindly refuse to add "a histological element" here, since the validation and confirmation of microCT imaging findings with histology has been demonstrated multiple times by us [@doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00099.2017; @doi:10.1038/srep41842] and other authors; we happily stand on the shoulders of giants.

> Limitations - While this is a limitation of the technology, this is not a limitation of your study.
> Please expand this section to encompasses where your studies are lacking.

We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment.
We have expanded and adapted the section and described some limitations in more detail.

> Further, I would encourage a cost comparison to competitive products.
> Yes, it seems to work better, but is the cost worth it or even feasible.

Since our manuscript is neither a review nor a contrast agent market overview we kindly refuse to add a cost comparison of all the different available contrast agents for perfusing the vasculature.
