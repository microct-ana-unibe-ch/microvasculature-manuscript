## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Angiogenesis is an essential physiological vascularization process for skeletal development and growth as well as for bone healing and regeneration.
This formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels is crucial for successful bone formation and repair [@doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3389/fendo.2013.00106, @doi:10.1007/s10456-017-9541-1; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
In addition to carrying nutrients and growth factors, those newly formed blood vessels are a delivery route of stem cells and progenitor cells to the bone-defect site [@doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.07.050; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2019.02.021; @doi:10.3389/fbioe.2017.00068].
The structural nature of skeletal tissue makes three-dimensional (3D) imaging of its vasculature extremely difficult.
Histology, a destructive and two-dimensional approach, still remains a gold standard for assessing vasculature in bones [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
Classic soft tissue imaging techniques such as light sheet microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy face challenges in their application due to the encasement of blood vessels in calcified tissue [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
Despite recent advancements in tissue clearing-based imaging methods for craniofacial bones in a mouse model [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26455-w;@10.1089/scd.2019.0104], the application of such methods remains challenging.
In the case of bone grafts, many of the synthetic ones fail to bridge critically sized defects due to their inability to promote vascularization [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0085; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
In essence, simultaneous non-destructive 3D imaging of the vasculature within bone tissue and of the bone tissue itself, especially in the case of larger bone grafts, has been a challenge for decades [@doi:10.1007/s10439-015-1253-3; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Thus, many research areas benefit from an improved three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the vasculature within bone tissue: for example bone metastatic disease, bone biology, tissue engineering, implantology, reconstructive surgery and healing of both small and critical size bone defects with or without bone grafts.

In the last decades, X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) gained recognition as a non-destructive 3D imaging technique for bone morphology [@doi:10.3389/fendo.2015.00122].
Due to the inherently low difference in X-ray absorption levels between vessels and different soft tissues it is not easily feasible to distinguish such structures within the bone.
To unambiguously detect vasculature within bone it is thus necessary to instill the vessels with either a contrast agent or use a casting method to otherwise fill the blood vessels.
Currently existing protocols for imaging a the vasculature within the bone via a vascular replica, have drawbacks like showing disjoint vascular components or completely missing vascular segments [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20720; @doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
It was also reported that the contrast difference between the perfusion agent to generate the replica of the vascular network an the mineralized bone make it problematic to perform a distinct segmentation of the bone tissue and the vasculature.
This issue can be overcome by decalcifying samples prior to vascular imaging.
Such a decalcification procedure makes simultaneous assessment of the intracortical bone microstructure and the vascular morphology impossible, though [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].

Intravascular contrast-agent-enhanced microCT has the potential to overcome these issues.
It has become a method of choice for the evaluation of angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering and remodeling applications [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2008.0153; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Barium sulfate and Microfil have been applied as the two most common contrast agents in studies on the vascularization of bone tissue.
Only some selected studies [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051] managed to show better perfusion and thus visualization when perfusing the vasculature with barium sulfate.
Previous studies have reported disadvantages associated with barium sulfate suspensions, including higher viscosity, which can sometimes result in incomplete vascular filling and weak or inhomogeneous signal, particularly in higher resolution scans [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051].
These issues may be attributed to particle aggregation, as indicated by various studies [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20263; @doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263].

Although Microfil has probably been applied in a larger number of vasculature imaging studies than barium sulfate, Microfil was reported to have disadvantages like poor or incomplete filling of the vasculature [@doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263] or vascular damage [@doi:10.1002/jnr.24539].

The problem of contrasting the vasculature becomes even further compounded in the presence of a metal implant.
Even though such implants have revolutionized the treatment of patients with missing teeth or injured joints and bones [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.016], they are problematic for the tomographic image acquisition.
Due to their large X-ray absorption, metal implants produce beam hardening, partial volume and low signal artifacts in the resulting tomographic datasets [@isbn:0819444251].
Interactions occurring at the tissue-implant interface are widely believed to play a crucial role in the success of implant placement and healing [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.06.023].
High resolution imaging of the tissue-implant interface is complicated due to the aforementioned artifacts from the metal implants.
Imaging with increased acceleration voltage and at small resolutions alleviates the imaging artifacts and makes microCT imaging the only available approach to non-destructively investigate the intact bone-implant interface in both 3D [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] and at in close proximity to the implant surface (i.e. closer than 200 µn).
<!-- Really this close? Oleksiy has to give some detailed input on this.-->

Beyond studying the anatomy and physiology of angiogenesis and vasculature of the bone itself, the contribution of the vascular component in the healing process around bone-borne implants is also considered an area of study meriting further experimentation [@doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022; @doi:10.1111/jcpe.12424].
To date, only few studies tried to assess and visualize the vasculature surrounding implants using microCT imaging, for examples see [@doi:10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109873], where Wang et al. assessed a region of 100 μm around the implant surface and [@doi:10.1038/s41592-021-01363-5], where Bhargava et al. present VascuViz, a pipeline for vascular systems biology and compare it to other vascular imaging workflows.
Both these studies image the samples at approximately 7 μm voxel size, inhibiting the assessment of microvessels with a diameter of approximately 40 µm or less.
To the best of our knowledge, no study has managed to resolve the microvascular component in a large animal model due to the technical limitations of the perfused contrast agent and the applied microCT imaging technique.

The present study introduces the polymer-based contrast agent µAngiofil for high-resolution microCT-based visualization of microvasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models, both with and without decalcification of the bone.
Moreover, we show that µAngiofil is suitable for simultaneous imaging and subsequent analysis of peri-implant hard and soft tissues as well as their vascularization in the vicinity of metal implants in a large animal model.
