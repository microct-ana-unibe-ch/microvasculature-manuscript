## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, is crucial for skeletal development as well as for bone healing and regeneration [@doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3389/fendo.2013.00106; @doi:10.1007/s10456-017-9541-1; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
In addition to carrying nutrients and growth factors, those newly formed blood vessels are a delivery route of stem cells and progenitor cells to the bone-defect site [@doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.07.050; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2019.02.021; @doi:10.3389/fbioe.2017.00068].
In the case of bone grafts, many synthetic ones fail to bridge critically sized defects due to their inability to promote vascularization [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0085; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
The structural nature of skeletal tissue makes three-dimensional (3D) imaging of its vasculature extremely difficult.
Histology, a destructive and two-dimensional approach, still remains a gold standard for assessing vasculature in bones [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].

Classic soft tissue imaging techniques such as light sheet microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy face challenges in their application due to the encasement of blood vessels in calcified tissue [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
Despite recent advances in tissue clearing-based imaging methods for craniofacial and other bones [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.031; @doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26455-w; @doi:10.1089/scd.2019.0104] as well as for whole body [@doi:10.1038/s41596-022-00788-2], the application of such methods remains challenging and is mainly limited to small animal models.
Simultaneous non-destructive 3D imaging of the vasculature within bone tissue and of the bone tissue itself, especially in the case of larger bone grafts, has been a challenge for decades [@doi:10.1007/s10439-015-1253-3; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Thus, many research areas benefit from improved three-dimensional imaging of the vasculature within bone tissue, for example bone biology, bone metastatic disease, tissue engineering, implantology, and reconstructive surgery.

In the last decades, X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) gained recognition as a non-destructive 3D imaging technique for bone morphology [@doi:10.3389/fendo.2015.00122].
Due to the inherently low difference in X-ray absorption levels between vessels and different soft tissues, it is not easily feasible to distinguish such structures within the bone.
To unambiguously detect vasculature within bone it is thus necessary to instill the vessels with either a contrast agent or use a casting method to otherwise fill the blood vessels.
Currently, existing protocols for imaging the vasculature within the bone via vascular replica have drawbacks, like showing disjoint vascular components or completely missing vascular segments [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20720; @doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
The minor contrast difference between the perfusion agent used to generate the vascular network replica and the mineralized bone makes it problematic to distinguish bone tissue and vasculature.
To enable proper visualization and segmentation of vasculature within bone tissue, decalcifying the bone samples has become practically a standard method [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051].
Such a decalcification procedure makes a simultaneous assessment of bone microstructure and vascular morphology impossible [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
Although in a recent study by Rosenblum et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100151], in a small animal model study without biomedical implants, it was shown that this limitation can be overcome by iterative microCT-imaging (pre- and post-decalcification).

Intravascular contrast-agent-enhanced microCT has the potential to overcome these issues.
It has become a method of choice for the evaluation of angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering and remodeling applications [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2008.0153; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Barium sulfate and Microfil have been applied as the two most common contrast agents in studies on the vascularization of bone tissue.
Only some selected studies [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051] managed to show better perfusion and thus visualization when perfusing the vasculature with barium sulfate.
Previous studies have reported disadvantages associated with barium sulfate suspensions, including higher viscosity, which can sometimes result in incomplete vascular filling and weak or inhomogeneous signal, particularly in higher resolution scans [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051].
These issues may be attributed to particle aggregation, as indicated by various studies [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20263; @doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263].
Although Microfil has probably been applied in a larger number of vasculature imaging studies than barium sulfate, Microfil was reported to have disadvantages like vascular damage [@doi:10.1002/jnr.24539] as well as poor or incomplete filling of the vasculature [@doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263].

In the study of tumor models [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-3999-2_2], assessing and non-destructively imaging tumor vasculature in 3D is a demanding task.
Due to the intraosseous location, imaging is even more challenging in a bone metastatic disease model.
Changes in bone and vasculature are of crucial importance for the progression of bone metastatic disease.
Therefore, simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature is highly desired, making a decalcification step unfavorable.
It is thus of paramount importance to develop an imaging method for the assessment of tumor vasculature in the bone without decalcification, which renders bone microstructure X-ray transparent.
In this manuscript, we present such a method for visualizing intratumoral vasculature and defects in mineralized bone tissue.

The craniofacial skeleton, including the mandible, is a frequent location for distraction osteogenesis as well as other forms of bone regeneration and repair, for which vascularization is important [@doi:10.1007/s10456-017-9541-1; @doi:10.1055/s-0032-1329540].
Even though metal implants have revolutionized the treatment of patients with missing teeth or injured joints and bones [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.016], they are problematic for tomographic image acquisition.
The problem of imaging the vasculature becomes even further compounded in their presence, for example when studying vascularization in a jaw with metal implants.
Due to their high X-ray absorption, metal implants produce beam hardening, partial volume, and low signal artifacts in the resulting tomographic datasets [@isbn:0819444251].
Interactions occurring at the tissue-implant interface are widely believed to play a crucial role in the success of implant placement and healing [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.06.023].
High-resolution tomographic imaging of the tissue-implant interface is complicated due to the aforementioned artifacts from the metal implants.
Imaging with increased acceleration voltage and at small resolutions alleviates these imaging artifacts.
MicroCT imaging is the only available approach to non-destructively investigate the intact bone-implant interface in both 3D [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] and in proximity to the implant surface (i.e. closer than 100 μm).

Implantology and osteology studies are often conducted in large animal models rendering the corresponding imaging even more complicated due to the lack of transgenic lines as well as the larger size of the harvested samples.
The Göttingen Minipig is widely recognized as a valuable large animal model in preclinical dental and orofacial research, mainly because of its anatomical similarities to humans [@doi:10.1111/j.1601-0825.2006.01337.x; @doi:10.22203/eCM.v013a01; @doi:10.1201/b11356-37].
Its bone structure and bone remodeling processes closely resemble those of humans, further enhancing its suitability for such studies, including ours.

The present study introduces a technique for high-resolution microCT-based visualization of microvasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models, both with and without decalcification of the bone.
Moreover, we show that the polymer-based contrast agent μAngiofil is suitable for simultaneous imaging and subsequent analysis of peri-implant hard and soft tissues as well as their vascularization in the vicinity of metal implants in a large animal model.
