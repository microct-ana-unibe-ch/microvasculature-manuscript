## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, is crucial for skeletal development and bone healing and regeneration [@doi:10.1002/jbm.a.32411; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3389/fendo.2013.00106; @doi:10.1007/s10456-017-9541-1; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
In addition to carrying nutrients and growth factors, these newly formed blood vessels serve as a delivery route for stem cells and progenitor cells to the bone defect site [@doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.07.050; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2019.02.021; @doi:10.3389/fbioe.2017.00068].
In the case of bone grafts, many synthetic bone grafts fail to bridge critically sized defects due to their inability to promote vascularization [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0085; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
The structural nature of skeletal tissue makes three-dimensional (3D) imaging of its vasculature extremely difficult.
Histology, a destructive and two-dimensional approach, remains the gold standard for assessing vasculature in bones [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].

Classic soft tissue imaging techniques such as light sheet microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy face challenges in their application due to the encasement of blood vessels in calcified tissue [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
Despite recent advances in tissue-clearing-based imaging methods for craniofacial and other bones [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.031; @doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26455-w; @doi:10.1089/scd.2019.0104] and the whole body [@doi:10.1038/s41596-022-00788-2], the application of such methods remains challenging and is largely limited to small animal models.
Simultaneously imaging both vasculature and bone tissue non-destructively in 3D has long been a challenge, especially in large bone grafts or near metal implants [@doi:10.1007/s10439-015-1253-3; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Thus, many research areas, such as tissue engineering, implantology, reconstructive surgery, bone biology, and bone metastatic disease, benefit from improved three-dimensional imaging of the vasculature within bone tissue.

In the last decades, X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) gained recognition as a non-destructive 3D imaging technique for bone morphology [@doi:10.3389/fendo.2015.00122].
Due to the inherently low difference in X-ray absorption levels between vessels and different soft tissues, it is not easily feasible to distinguish such structures within the bone.
To unambiguously detect vasculature within bone, it is necessary to instill the vessels with a contrast agent or use a casting method to fill the blood vessels.
Another alternative to detect vessels within bone is synchrotron-radiation-based tomography, specifically employing phase-contrast tomography [@doi:10.3389/fphys.2017.00769].
Although it has potential, synchrotron-radiation-based tomography is not as easily attainable for most preclinical researchers as microCT and has severe drawbacks in terms of visualized sample volume.

Currently, existing protocols for imaging the vasculature within bone via vascular replicas have drawbacks, such as disjoint vascular components or completely missing vascular segments [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20720; @doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
The minor contrast difference between the perfusion agent used to generate the vascular network replica and the mineralized bone makes it problematic to distinguish bone tissue and vasculature.
To enable proper visualization and segmentation of vasculature within bone tissue, decalcifying the bone samples has become practically a standard method [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051].
This decalcification procedure makes simultaneous assessment of bone microstructure and vascular morphology impossible [@doi:10.1038/s41598-017-13632-5].
However, in a recent study by Rosenblum et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100151], in a small animal model study without biomedical implants, this limitation was shown to be overcome by iterative microCT imaging (pre- and post-decalcification).

Intravascular contrast-agent-enhanced microCT has the potential to overcome the mentioned issues.
It has become a method of choice for the evaluation of angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering and remodeling applications [@doi:10.1089/ten.teb.2008.0153; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00195.2022].
Barium sulfate and Microfil are the two most commonly used contrast agents in studies on the vascularization of bone tissue.
Only some selected studies [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051] managed to show better perfusion and thus visualization when perfusing the vasculature with barium sulfate.
Previous studies have reported disadvantages associated with barium sulfate suspensions, including higher viscosity, which can result in incomplete vascular filling and weak or inhomogeneous signals, particularly in higher-resolution scans [@doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051].
These issues may be attributed to particle aggregation, as indicated by various studies [@doi:10.1002/jemt.20263; @doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263].
Although Microfil has probably been applied in a larger number of vasculature imaging studies than barium sulfate, Microfil was reported to have disadvantages like vascular damage [@doi:10.1002/jnr.24539] and poor or incomplete filling of the vasculature [@doi:10.1186/s12882-016-0235-5; @doi:10.1016/j.bone.2011.09.051; @doi:10.3390/ijms22063263].

In the study of tumor models [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-3999-2_2], assessing and non-destructively imaging tumor vasculature in 3D is a demanding task.
Due to its intraosseous location, imaging is even more challenging in a bone metastatic disease model.
Changes in bone and vasculature are of crucial importance for the progression of bone metastatic disease.
Therefore, simultaneous imaging of bone and vasculature is highly desired, making a decalcification step unfavorable.
It is therefore of paramount importance to develop an imaging method for assessing tumor vasculature in bone without decalcification, which renders the bone microstructure X-ray transparent.
In this manuscript, we present such a method for visualizing intratumoral vasculature and defects in mineralized bone tissue.

The craniofacial skeleton, including the mandible, is a frequent location for distraction osteogenesis and other forms of bone regeneration and repair, for which vascularization is important [@doi:10.1007/s10456-017-9541-1; @doi:10.1055/s-0032-1329540].
Even though metal implants have revolutionized the treatment of patients with missing teeth or injured joints and bones [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.016], they are problematic for 3D imaging.
The problem of imaging the vasculature is further compounded by their presence, for example, when studying vascularization in a jaw with metal implants.
Due to their high X-ray absorption, metal implants produce beam hardening, partial volume, and low signal artifacts in the resulting tomographic datasets [@isbn:0819444251].
Interactions occurring at the tissue-implant interface are widely believed to play a crucial role in the success of implant placement and healing [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578; @doi:10.1016/j.actbio.2018.06.023].
High-resolution tomographic imaging of the tissue-implant interface is complicated by artifacts from the metal implants in the resulting datasets.
Imaging with increased acceleration voltage and at low resolutions alleviates these imaging artifacts.
MicroCT imaging is the only available approach for non-destructively investigating the intact bone-implant interface in 3D [@doi:10.1111/cpr.12578] and in proximity to the implant surface (i.e. closer than 100 μm).

Implantology and osteology studies are often conducted in large animal models making the corresponding imaging even more complicated due to the lack of transgenic lines and the large size of the harvested samples.
The Göttingen Minipig is widely recognized as a valuable large animal model in preclinical dental and orofacial research, mainly because of its anatomical similarities to humans [@doi:10.1111/j.1601-0825.2006.01337.x; @doi:10.22203/eCM.v013a01; @doi:10.1201/b11356-37].
Its bone structure and bone remodeling processes closely resemble those of humans, further enhancing its suitability for such studies, including ours.

The present study introduces a technique for microCT-based visualization of microvasculature within bone tissue in small and large animal models.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this approach is suitable for simultaneous imaging and subsequent analysis of peri-implant hard and soft tissues, as well as their vascularization, in the vicinity of metal implants in a large animal model.
